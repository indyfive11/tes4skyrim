## Papyrus / Script Conversion Notes
<a id="papyrus-script-conversion-notes"></a>

Linked from [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md). TES4 script → Papyrus conversion
learnings. Implemented in `script_convert/`. For the original scope analysis and
record counts see [Script_Conversion_Plan.md](script_convert.md).

## Language mapping basics
<a id="language-mapping-basics"></a>

TES4 uses an imperative scripting language with event blocks (GameMode,
OnActivate, …). TES5 uses Papyrus, an object-oriented language.

- Variables become Properties: `short myVar` → `Int Property myVar Auto`
- Event blocks change: `begin OnActivate` → `Event OnActivate(ObjectReference akActionRef)`
- Functions change: `Message "text"` → `Debug.Notification("text")`
- TES4 `set x to y` → `x = y`
- Player reference: `player.` → `Game.GetPlayer().`
- No direct equivalent for: GetInCell (→IsInLocation), ShowMap, CloseOblivionGate, SetQuestObject
- TES4 attributes (Strength, etc.) have no Papyrus equivalent — reads are
  stubbed open and writes dropped, never aliased onto a look-alike actor value
  (see "Skyrim has NO attributes" below)
- Vanilla forms with no TES4 counterpart are reached via
  `Game.GetFormFromFile(0x..., "Skyrim.esm")` in TES4Polyfill (ActorTypeNPC
  keyword for GetIsCreature, GuardDialogueFaction for IsGuard,
  PlayerVampireQuestScript.VampireStatus for HasVampireFed) — no property
  binding needed.

**Vanilla Papyrus has more than the wikis suggest** — check the game's
`Data/Source/Scripts/*.psc` headers before declaring something unconvertible.
`Faction.SetReaction/ModReaction`, `Actor.GetCurrentPackage()` (→
GetIsCurrentPackage/GetCurrentAIPackage-vs-form),
`ObjectReference.PushActorAway` and
`ObjectReference.GetAnimationVariableBool("bAnimPlaying")` (→ IsAnimPlaying) all
exist and are used by the converter. (`bAnimPlaying` is not a vanilla variable:
the native exists, the name is ours, and every generated animated-object graph
declares it — see
[bAnimPlaying](asset_convert_animation.md#playing-variable).)

## Paired on/off commands — the asymmetric-map trap
<a id="paired-onoff-commands-asymmetric-map"></a>

**A `;NE:` (no-equivalent) comment on ONE HALF of a paired on/off command is a
latent soft-lock, not a cosmetic gap.** When the "on" half converts to a
state-changing call and the "off" half is a no-op, the actor can never return to
the original state. Audit the partner call before accepting either.

- **`SetAlert` is NATIVE in both games (`Actor.SetAlert(bool)`) — never
  approximate it with `DrawWeapon()`.** Oblivion's SetAlert sets the AI
  combat-READINESS flag; the engine clears it and it does NOT suppress dialogue.
  The old mapping sent `SetAlert 1`→`DrawWeapon()` while `SetAlert 0` was a
  silent no-op, so any actor alerted for a scripted ambush drew a weapon and
  NEVER stood down. CharacterGen alerts Uriel for the prison-cell ambush (stage
  15) and clears it at stages 17/24 to run the conversation — converted Uriel
  stood weapon-drawn, could not force-greet, and the intro SOFT-LOCKED with
  player controls disabled. 97 scripts across the game use SetAlert, most in
  talking scenes (MQ13/MQ14 Bruma, SE06 battle, MS13), not fights.

- **`ResetFallDamageTimer` (2026-07-31)** was a `;NE:` no-op with no "on" half
  at all, so a levitation/flight effect converted to a spell that dropped the
  player to their death. Skyrim keeps the console command (opcode 4404) but
  binds no Papyrus equivalent, and `fJumpFallHeightMin` has readers but no
  vanilla writer. It now calls `TES4Polyfill.SuppressFallDamage()`, and the
  converter **injects the paired `RestoreFallDamage()` into the teardown
  event** — synthesizing an `OnEffectFinish` when the script has none, so the
  suppression can never outlive the effect. The injection is a post-pass run
  after the synthesized `OnInit`/`OnUpdate` are appended, because TES4 does not
  order its blocks and the teardown event must already be in the output for the
  restore to land inside it. `SetGhost`/`SetInvulnerable` were rejected as the
  mechanism: both suppress ALL damage, so the scroll would grant temporary
  immortality — a worse defect than the one being fixed. The suppression itself
  is now a falling-damage perk, not DamageResist:
  [fall damage is a perk](#fall-damage-is-a-perk).

## SetRestrained suspends ALL AI, not just movement (2026-10-01)
<a id="setrestrained-suspends-all-ai"></a>

**Oblivion's `setrestrained 1` suspended an actor's ENTIRE AI — it stopped
moving AND stopped fighting — and resumed it on `setrestrained 0`. The old map
to `SetDontMove` froze only movement, so a "restrained" actor stayed in
combat.** This is the same asymmetric-map trap as `SetAlert` above, one level
deeper: the call converted and the actor stopped walking, so it *looked* right,
but the combat half was silently dropped. A single restrained actor still in
combat keeps its whole group in combat, and Skyrim will not run an escort or
travel package while the package owner is in combat — `EvaluatePackage()` does
not override the combat controller.

**Receipt — the CharGen stage-50 escort stall.** After the birthsign the
tutorial restrains the three second-wave assassins (`CGGenericAssassin1/2/3`,
"Move out!") so the Emperor's escort can proceed. Converted with `SetDontMove`
they stopped walking but stayed aggroed, so the group never left combat, the
Emperor's `CGGlenroyEscortEmperorToF` package never ran, its `OnPackageDone`
never set stage 52, and Baurus never followed — a soft-lock of a quest needed
much later. (It is also why the combat-end re-eval seam could not help: combat
never *ended*, so `OnCombatStateChanged(0)` never fired.)

**The fix is general, not tutorial-specific.** A census of the whole master
found 85 `setrestrained` calls across 35 records / 23 logical sites — SE03
Gnarl, MS10 Ulrich (rats must kill him), MS52 Agronak, the Dark Brotherhood
finale execution, MQ09/MQ15/MQ16, MS27 Umbacano, E3 Kvatch, and CharGen — not
one isolated bug. `setrestrained` now routes through
`TES4Polyfill.SetRestrained(akActor, abRestrain)`, which keeps `SetDontMove`
and adds the dropped halves: **`StopCombat()` on restrain** (the pacify Oblivion
gave free) and **`EvaluatePackage()` on release** (the resume Oblivion did
continuously but Skyrim must be nudged into — several release sites, e.g. the
CharGen final-ambush trigger zone and the MQ16 Dagon stagger, have no explicit
re-eval after `setrestrained 0`).

**Aggression is deliberately left untouched.** The tempting "zero aggression on
restrain, restore it on release" is wrong: the source scripts manage aggression
themselves around `setrestrained`, and auto-restoring would clobber them. The
decisive case is MS27 Umbacano — his script runs `setav aggression 50` and then
`setrestrained 0` so he attacks; a restore-to-base on release would overwrite
the 50 with his noble base aggression and he would never fight, soft-locking the
quest. MS52 Agronak shows the same convention from the other side: the script
itself calls `StopCombat` + `SetAV Aggression 0` by hand. The actor's current
aggression is the author's intent; the helper preserves it.

**Why not the `Actor.SetRestrained` native?** Skyrim *does* have one, but it
also stops only movement (Bethesda's own scripts pair it with a separate
`StopCombatAlarm()`/`EvaluatePackage()`, e.g. `QF_MQ301` for Odahviing), so it
would not fix the bug and would change the immobilization behavior at all 23
sites for no gain. Keeping `SetDontMove` plus the combat/resume halves is the
minimal change that actually closes the gap.

## ResetFallDamageTimer is a falling-damage perk window (2026-09-25, unconfirmed in game)
<a id="fall-damage-is-a-perk"></a>

**The old mechanism did nothing to falls.** `SuppressFallDamage` forced
`DamageResist` to 10000. Skyrim's falling damage is
`((height - fJumpFallHeightMin) * fJumpFallHeightMult) ^ fJumpFallHeightExponent * modifiers`,
where the only modifiers are perk entry points (UESP Skyrim:Damage). There is no
armor term, so the forced resistance left falls untouched and handed out an 80%
physical damage cut instead. The call also had no subject outside a magic
effect, so `SE02GatekeeperScript`'s every-tick `ResetFallDamageTimer` forced the
PLAYER's resistance. `TG11FallingExit`'s one-shot `Player.ResetFallDamageTimer`
did the same, permanently, because neither script has a teardown.

**The engine's own mechanism** is perk entry point 58, Mod Falling Damage. Vanilla
Cushioned uses it at ×0.5. Papyrus `AddPerk` works only on the player, and a
magic effect's PerkToApply is how any actor holds a perk. Vanilla does both:
`NN01PerkEffect` (constant) and `ghostExtraDamageEffect` (fire-and-forget).

**Fix:** the importer writes `TES4NoFallDamagePerk` (entry point 58, Multiply
Value ×0, unconditioned like `TGSkeletonKeyPerk`), `TES4NoFallDamageEffect`
(Value Modifier Health at magnitude 0, PerkToApply, hidden in the UI), and the
spell `TES4NoFallDamage`: fire-and-forget, Self, 10 s. A dependent plugin adopts
its master's copy by EditorID. `ResetFallDamageTimer` converts to
`TES4Polyfill.SuppressFallDamage(<actor>, TES4NoFallDamage)`, which casts the
spell on the calling actor. A caller that polls every tick keeps renewing the
window, and a one-shot caller gets one fall's worth. A magic effect's teardown
still dispels the spell early through `RestoreFallDamage`.

The effect must NOT carry No Magnitude. The engine turns that into magnitude
1.0, so every cast healed 1 HP/s for 10 s, and an every-tick caller stacked
about 27 of them
([no-magnitude-forces-one](tes5_import_magic.md#no-magnitude-forces-one)).

## Skyrim has GMST readers but no GMST writer (2026-07-31)
<a id="skyrim-has-gmst-readers-but"></a>

`Game.GetGameSettingFloat/Int/String` are vanilla natives. **`Game.SetGameSetting*`
is SKSE-only and does NOT compile against the vanilla headers this pipeline
builds with** — verified directly against `papyrus.exe`: a script calling the
setter fails with "undefined function `SetGameSettingFloat`" on the same line
the getter resolves fine.

So OBSE's `SetNumericGameSetting` cannot convert literally. The settings that
have a per-actor equivalent go through `Actor.ForceActorValue` instead
(`_GMST_TO_ACTOR_VALUE` in `script_convert/converter.py`) — same observable
change, scoped to the actor rather than the world, which is what these scripts
actually want. Two rules fall out:

- **The READ must use the same channel as the WRITE.** These scripts all use the
  save/restore idiom ("remember the old value, set a new one, put it back"); if
  the getter still goes to the global GMST it reads back a number the write
  never changed, and the restore writes garbage. `GetGameSetting` is redirected
  to `GetActorValue` for exactly the settings in the table.
- **`fJumpHeightMax` does not exist in Skyrim** — only `fJumpHeightMin`.
  Confirmed against both Skyrim.esm's GMST records and the SkyrimSE.exe settings
  strings. A TES4 script that sets both is writing one real setting and one
  Oblivion had that Skyrim dropped; the second write is a harmless no-op.

Settings with no actor-value equivalent keep a `;TODO` marker — a call that
compiles and silently does nothing is the dangerous outcome, not the honest one.

## FO3/FNV script blocks
<a id="fo3fnv-script-blocks"></a>

**Code:** `script_convert/constants_falloutnv.py`

`assemble` looks a block type up in `BLOCK_MAP` and, on a miss, `continue`s --
dropping the block **body and all**, silently. Oblivion's vocabulary covers
Oblivion, so a FO3/FNV-only block type was pure data loss.

Measured over `export/FalloutNV.esm/SCPT.txt`: 2,581 scripts, **3,876 `begin`
blocks**, of which 183 are types Oblivion never emits.

| FO3/FNV block | blocks | Papyrus |
|---|---:|---|
| `saytodone` | 133 | none -- no dialogue-complete event |
| `oncombatend` | 26 | `OnCombatStateChanged`, guard `aeCombatState == 0` |
| `ondestructionstagechange` | 11 | `OnDestructionStageChanged(int, int)` |
| `ongrab` | 4 | `OnGrab()` |
| `onrelease` | 3 | `OnRelease()` |
| `onfire` | 3 | none -- FNV weapon-fire hook |
| `onopen` | 2 | `OnOpen(ObjectReference akActionRef)` |
| `onclose` | 1 | `OnClose(ObjectReference akActionRef)` |

Signatures are taken verbatim from
`references/SkyrimCKWiki_210522/skyrim/<Event>_-_ObjectReference.html`, never
invented. `oncombatend` reuses the existing `COMBAT_STATE_GUARDS` mechanism
that already merges `onalarm` and `onstartcombat` into the one event.

`saytodone` and `onfire` have no Skyrim equivalent: 136 blocks whose bodies
still reach the script, now as an inert `;TODO:` rather than vanishing.

## Comparing an inert operand
<a id="comparing-an-inert-operand"></a>

**Code:** `_inert_note` / `_bool_literal_cmp` in `script_convert/emit/expr.py`

A command with no Papyrus equivalent yields `note()`'s inert `0`, which is
right in a VALUE position (`getdeadcount X + 3`) and wrong in a COMPARISON:
the authored test supplies its own literal, so `Target.isActor == 0` converts
to `0 == 0` — always true.

Nehrim's freeze and impact spells are the case in point. All six author

```
if (Target.isActor == 0) || (Target.getDead == 1) || (Target.isRidingHorse == 1)
    Return
endif
```

`isActor` has no Papyrus native, so the guard returned unconditionally and the
spell never fired — a silent kill that still compiled. Measured over the three
test plugins, 9 scripts hit this: `SpellEinfrieren10/15/18/100Prozent`,
`SpellEinschlag12/100Prozent`, `TrigZoneEMCStopHoldMusicSCRIPT` and two more.

The comparison therefore hands the note back instead of an answer, and the
term drops out of its `&&`/`||` chain exactly as a bare unknown operand does.
Dropping a term from an `&&` widens the guard and from an `||` narrows it;
inventing `0 == 0` instead decides it.

### An inert read must never FIRE a guard
<a id="an-inert-read-must-never-fire"></a>

Outside a chain the note used to stay inert (`0`), on the reasoning that a lone
`If <unknown> == 0` has no surviving term to carry the line, and handing the
note back would comment out the `If` itself.

That reasoning covers the LINE but not the LOGIC. `0` compared against the
author's own literal is still a decided answer, and half the time it decides
wrong in the dangerous direction:

| Authored | Emitted | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `if <unknown> == 1` | `If (0 == 1)` | always false — body dead, **safe** |
| `if <unknown> == 0` | `If 0 == 0` | always TRUE — **guard gone** |

Nehrim's `Nexusplanet01SCN` was the clear case: `if GetIgnoreFriendlyHits == 0`
means "friendly hits are not ignored, so retaliate". The read was then
(wrongly) inert, so the guard became unconditional — the NPC force-combats the
player every time. It now maps to `IsIgnoringFriendlyHits()`.

The comparison therefore folds to the literal `false` when its operand went
inert, which keeps the `If` intact (no paren swallowing), keeps the `;NE:` note
on the line, and makes both directions fail SAFE. This matches what the `== 1`
half already did by accident.

Measured across all four plugins before the fix: **668 constant guards from a
neutralised read** — FalloutNV 538 in 377 files, Nehrim 92 in 39, Morroblivion
25 in 10, Oblivion 13 in 5. The dangerous `== 0` direction is 272 of FNV's and
32 of Nehrim's.

### When EVERY term drops

`DAMephalaUlfgarFactionScript` guards on
`(GetCrimeKnown 0 Player NivanDalviluRef == 1) || (GetCrimeKnown 1 ... == 1)`.
`GetCrimeKnown` has no Papyrus native, so both sides vanish and the chain has
nothing left. Falling back to `True` sets `BleakerCrime` on every frame — the
Bleaker's Way massacre quest treats the player as a known criminal from the
start. The fallback therefore follows the operator's own direction: `False`
for `||`, `True` for `&&`. Measured over the three test plugins, 32 scripts
emit the `||` fallback — 29 in Oblivion (the Mephala faction pair plus 27
`QF_*` quest scripts guarding on `GetCrimeKnown`) and 3 in Morroblivion;
Nehrim has none.

## Block type mapping
<a id="block-type-mapping"></a>

**Code:** `script_convert/blocks.py`

`BLOCK_MAP` is the vocabulary of what survives conversion: `assemble` looks the
block type up and, on a miss, drops the block body and all. The rationale that
used to sit as comments beside the table:

**`OnTrigger` is per-frame, not an edge.** TES4 `Begin OnTrigger` runs EVERY
FRAME an object is inside the volume -- Nehrim's Magieverbot (magic-ban)
scripts count 25 and 100 *executions* in it, which is only meaningful under
repeat semantics. Skyrim keeps the same three-way split (all three are distinct
engine events in SkyrimSE.exe): `OnTrigger` is sent repeatedly while inside,
`OnTriggerEnter`/`OnTriggerLeave` are the edges. Mapping `OnTrigger` ->
`OnTriggerEnter` froze every such state machine on its first state, which left
the Erothin bell latch stuck and re-ringing.

**`OnTriggerActor` / `OnTriggerMob`** differ from `OnTrigger` only in WHAT trips
them (any actor / any creature), not in edge-vs-repeat, so they take the
repeating event too. Skyrim has no actor-vs-creature split, so the filter is
left to the block body.

**`OnAlarm`** (actor noticed a crime/attack) has no Papyrus event; entering
combat/search via `OnCombatStateChanged` is the closest trigger. The block loop
adds an `aeCombatState` guard per block type so several block types merge
cleanly into the one event -- that is what `COMBAT_STATE_GUARDS` is for.

**The `scripteffect*` signatures are fixed by `ActiveMagicEffect.psc`** -- an
invented one fails to compile ("the parameter types of function oneffectstart
... do not match the parent script activemagiceffect").

**Block filters** (`begin OnEquip player`) restrict a block to one object;
Papyrus has no such filter, so the body is wrapped in a guard on the event
parameter that carries the filtered object. A block type absent from
`BLOCK_FILTER_PARAM` has no such parameter, so its filter is dropped with a
TODO.

## Block filter guards
<a id="block-filter-guards"></a>

**Code:** `block_filter_guard` in `script_convert/blocks.py`

`begin OnEquip player` fires the block ONLY when the player equips the item;
`begin OnPackageDone SomePkg` only when that package ends. Papyrus events carry
no filter, so the restriction becomes an `If` around the body testing the event
parameter that holds the filtered object. Without it the block runs for every
actor / container / package -- which is how an item's "you can't equip this"
message ended up firing for NPCs the moment they loaded in.

**A block type with no parameter naming an object cannot be guarded.**
MenuMode's argument is a menu ID and OnAlarm's a crime type, so neither is in
`BLOCK_FILTER_PARAM` and their filters are dropped.

**The comparison has to typecheck against the event parameter.** On an ACTOR
script `begin OnEquip SomePotion` filters the ITEM equipped, not the equipper --
but Skyrim's `OnEquipped` only hands us the actor, so there is nothing to test
the item against. Emitting the comparison anyway gives
`akActor == SomePotion`, which does not compile; the filter is lost instead.

**A property already bound at another type is not automatically a conflict.**
A `TES4_*` script type extends Actor/ObjectReference, so the comparison still
compiles and the existing binding is kept -- dropping the guard there ran
CGRenote's `begin onHit CGAssassin01Ref` bodies on EVERY hit, so any stray arrow
killed her and jumped CharacterGen's stages out of order. A base record likewise
compares to a `Form` parameter perfectly well, and the body converts BEFORE the
guard, so the property is normally already bound at its own narrow type.

Genuinely incomparable (bound as Faction/GlobalVariable, say) returns None: an
unguarded body is WRONG for every event the filter excluded, so the caller keeps
the body but does not execute it.

<a id="onhitwith-ammo"></a>
**`OnHitWith <ammo>` is read off the shooter, not `akSource`.** For an arrow,
Skyrim's `OnHit` passes the BOW as `akSource` (CK wiki: "the Weapon, Spell,
Explosion, Ingredient, Potion, or Enchantment"), and `akProjectile` is None when
the target is an actor. So `akSource == SomeArrow` can never be true. An AMMO
filter instead becomes `TES4Polyfill.HitWithAmmo(akAggressor, SomeArrow)`: the
attacker is an actor with that ammo equipped (`Actor.IsEquipped`) and a bow (7)
or crossbow (12) in either hand (`GetEquippedItemType`). Both are vanilla
natives, so no SKSE is needed. The Shivering Isles Gatekeeper's eight
`OnHitWith SE02GKBoneArrowN` blocks never fired before this.

## Unknown commands must be inert
<a id="unknown-commands-must-be-inert"></a>

**Code:** `_is_known` / `emit_command` in `script_convert/emit/dispatch.py`

`_emit_mapped` renders a call under its **TES4** spelling when no row matches.
For a name Papyrus does not define that is an undefined function, and the
compiler rejects the whole script -- which then cascades, because one bad
script disables every script naming its type.

A name with no row, no handler and no prefix family therefore becomes a
`;TODO:` line instead of a call. The same rule already covered
`HANDLED_COMMANDS` (a handler-only command that fell past its handler); it now
covers genuinely unknown names too, which is what a non-TES4 source hits.

Measured over `export/FalloutNV.esm/SCPT.txt` -- 2,581 scripts, 3,876 `begin`
blocks -- **116 distinct unknown commands across 3,956 call sites**, none of
which has a Papyrus spelling. Highest-frequency, with their real equivalents:

| TES4 command | sites | Papyrus |
|---|---:|---|
| `setobjectivedisplayed` | 777 | `Quest.SetObjectiveDisplayed` |
| `setobjectivecompleted` | 404 | `Quest.SetObjectiveCompleted` |
| `setenemy` | 159 | `Faction.SetEnemy` |
| `setreputation` | 127 | none (FNV reputation) |
| `setquestdelay` | 110 | none (Papyrus has no poll delay) |
| `rewardxp` | 87 | `Game.AdvanceSkill` (approximate) |

Making the fallthrough inert is what lets those rows land incrementally: the
corpus compiles at every step instead of only once the last row is written.

## Silent mis-conversion — the unmarked loss
<a id="silent-mis-conversion-unmarked-loss"></a>

**A `;NE:`/`;TODO:` marker is the HEALTHY failure. The dangerous conversions are
the ones that emit a plausible call which compiles, runs, and does nothing.**
Audited output carries only 2 `;TODO:` markers across 18,566 scripts, so marker
counts measure honesty, not correctness — never treat a clean output scan as
evidence the conversion is complete.

### <a id="script-type-property-binding"></a>When an attached script class may stand in for a property type

**Code:** `script_convert/resolve_name.py:script_type_binds`

A property naming a record is normally typed by the record's signature. Where
the record carries an attached script, the generated script class is the more
useful type — it exposes that script's variables for cross-script reads — but
the VM refuses to bind a script class to a BASE object, so `script_type_may_override`
gates it.

One exception is measured: a scripted world object (ACTI/LIGH) with exactly ONE
placed ref binds fine, because the property binder redirects the binding to that
ref, which is what actually carries the script instance. Without the exception
the base gate stripped cross-script variables off unique activators and
`SE01Metronome.weatherVAR` and the SE11 trigzone stopped compiling.

Inventory types (ARMO/WEAP/…) stay excluded even with a lone world placement:
their properties mean the BASE (AddItem/RemoveItem), never that placement.

### <a id="generated-script-types"></a>🔴 A generated script type is recognized by PREFIX, and the prefix is per-game

**`is_generated_script_type()` in `script_convert/constants.py` is the ONLY way
to ask "did this pipeline emit that class". Never test `startswith('TES4_')`.**

The prefix comes from `script_prefix()`, which is `current_namespace().upper()`
— `TES4_` for Oblivion/Nehrim but `FALLOUTNV_` for FalloutNV.esm. A generated
class is the carrier of the source script's variable table, so the prefix test
is what these passes key on:

| Site | Answers False → |
|---|---|
| `converter.remote_type_of` | `Owner.Var` member type unresolved; no `as Int` cast on a `GetValue()` |
| `assemble._specific` | script type stops winning type inference |
| `emit/expr._is_form` | form-vs-number pun undetected |
| `blocks._rebind_existing` | two script classes compared directly |
| `constants.wants_placed_reference` | VMAD binds the BASE, property reads None |
| `commands._as_actor` | missing `as Actor` cast |

13 sites hardcoded `'TES4_'`. Under the FalloutNV namespace every one answered
False and **67 FalloutNV scripts stopped compiling** — `Float cannot be assigned
to Int` (the `remote_type_of` family), `field or property not found`, and
`you can't compare type X with type Y`. Oblivion was unaffected throughout,
which is exactly how a namespace-scoped regression hides.

`TES4_SecondsPassed`, `TES4_LastTick`, `TES4_pendingRelock`, `TES4_MsgButton`
and friends are generated LOCAL VARIABLE names, not script classes. They are
internal to one emitted script and never namespaced — leave them alone.

#### <a id="stem-a-script-type-via-script-edid-for"></a>Stem a script type with `_script_edid_for`, never by slicing

A longer prefix makes names truncate that never truncated before.
`GomorrahCasinoEnterTriggerScript` fits under `TES4_` (37 chars) but not under
`FALLOUTNV_`, so it becomes `FALLOUTNV_GomorrahCasinoEnterTrig_B9F2`. Slicing
the prefix off yields `gomorrahcasinoentertrig_b9f2`, which matches no
EditorID in `script_all_vars`.

`generated_script_stem()` is the plain slice and is only safe when the caller
does not need to hit `script_all_vars`. `_script_edid_for()` falls back to a
reverse map built from `papyrus_script_name(edid)`, so it recovers the real
EditorID through the truncation hash. **Any lookup keyed by script EditorID
must use it.** `_owning_scripts` and `_dangling_cross_script_target` both
sliced, so under FalloutNV their owner silently read as "unresolved" — which
in the dangling check means "don't fire", letting a genuinely bad cross-script
access through to the compiler.

#### <a id="dangling-cross-script-read"></a>A dangling cross-script access is AUTHORED, not a conversion bug

`GomorrahHotelDoorScript` writes `GomorrahCasinoEnterTriggerREF.Follower1`,
but that script declares only `Companion1REF`/`Companion2REF` — `Follower1` is
a variable of the CALLING script that the author also used as if it were the
target's. TES4 silently ignored the write; Papyrus rejects it at compile time.
The same area's `NVCCPlayerStorageActivatorScript` carries
`showWarning "Add Lily's ref ID to GomorrahCasinoEnterTriggerScript"`, so this
corner shipped unfinished.

`_dangling_cross_script_target` exists to convert these to a `;NE:` marker
rather than emit an access that cannot compile. It fires ONLY when the owner
resolves to a script whose variable table is KNOWN and lacks the name — an
unresolved owner is left alone, so it never suppresses a legitimate access.

### 🔴 An `as Actor` cast on a non-actor INVERTS every guard around it (2026-08-09)

**`(Self as Actor)` on an ObjectReference is `None` at runtime — and Papyrus
does not stop there. It aborts the call and substitutes `0` for the result**,
so a distance test built on it silently flips to always-true.

`MS48OblivionGateScript` rides on an ACTI (the Oblivion gate). TES4:

```
if getdistance player < 8000
    if MQ00.nearOblivionGate == 0 && getdistance player < 1000
        forceweather OblivionStormTamriel 1
```

emitted as `If (Self as Actor).GetDistance(Player) < 1000`. The gate is not an
actor, so the cast is None, the call aborts, the comparison reads `0 < 1000`,
and the gate hammered `OblivionStormTamriel.ForceActive()` **every 0.1s** while
the player crossed into the Plane of Oblivion. Papyrus.0.log shows the
signature 34x in the two seconds before the CTD:

```
error: Cannot call getDistance() on a None object, aborting function call
warning: Assigning None to a non-object variable named "::temp5"
```

Cause: `_ACTOR_ONLY_FUNCTIONS` and `_OBJREF_SHARED_FUNCTIONS` deliberately
overlap — 14 entries are declared on BOTH Actor and ObjectReference. The
ref'd-receiver site in `converter.py` subtracts the shared set; the
**implicit-Self site did not**, so any bare call to an overlapping function on
a non-actor script got the cast. Blast radius before the fix: **383 calls in
101 scripts** (137 GetDistance, 115 GetItemCount, 115 AddItem, 11 RemoveItem,
4 RemoveAllItems, 1 SetAlpha).

Rule: **every site that consults `_ACTOR_ONLY_FUNCTIONS` must subtract
`_OBJREF_SHARED_FUNCTIONS`.** Note `saa`/`setactoralpha` are deliberately NOT
in the shared set — their documented `(Self as Actor).SetAlpha()` degradation
is intentional and must survive. Guarded by
`tests/test_script_converter.py::TestObjRefSharedFunctionsNeverCastToActor`,
which asserts the invariant across the whole overlap, not just GetDistance.

This is the archetypal silent mis-conversion: it compiles, it is plausible, and
it does the opposite of the original.

### The two stages build DIFFERENT CrossRefGraphs (2026-07-31)

A conversion decision that depends on the graph can come out **differently in
the script stage than in the import stage**, because they do not share a graph:

| Stage | Writes | Builds its graph via |
|---|---|---|
| `--scripts-only` | the `.psc` / `.pex` | `CrossRefGraph.load_from_export()` (the parallel scan) |
| `--import-only` | the **VMAD property bindings** | hand-rolled loop over `all_records` in `import_main` |

`_resolve_props` re-runs the *whole converter* over the source to learn which
properties to bind. If the import's hand-built graph is missing a field the
scan collects, the converter takes a different branch there — and you get a
`.psc` that reads properties the VMAD never declares. They are `None` at
runtime: **as dead as whatever they replaced, while looking fixed in the
source.**

Found via R9-1 (`GetCurrentAIPackage`): the new `pack_type`/`actor_packages`
indexes existed only in the scan, so `TES4_MG17Script.psc` referenced six
`Package` properties and its VMAD declared 25 properties, none of them packages.

**Rule: anything added to `_scan_record_lines` must be mirrored into
`import_main`'s hand-built graph.** Verify with `tools/script/vmad_probe.py <esm>
<script> --props` — compare the bound set against the `.psc` declarations, and
never assume a correct-looking `.psc` means the binding happened.

### `extends` must be a base type EVERY attaching record can bind (2026-07-31)

The quietest failure in the pipeline so far. Papyrus binds a script to a form
only when the declared base type matches; a mismatch is rejected outright and
**nothing in the script runs** — no events, no poll, no properties:

```
error: Unable to bind script TES4_GoblinHeadScript to (1A08564B)
       because their base types do not match
```

It is invisible to every static check. `Actor extends ObjectReference`, so an
`extends Actor` script on a WEAP/ACTI/CONT/DOOR still **compiles cleanly** —
all 15,959 compiles passed while 67 scripts were dead in-game. The only place
it shows up is the Papyrus log.

Two independent sources of a wrong base type, both fixed in round 7 of the
quest-script audit ([quest_script_conversion.md](../audits/quest_script_conversion.md), R7-1):

* **`_infer_extends` overriding a correct answer.** `get_extends_class` derives
  the type from the attaching record's signature and is right; the bare-call
  pre-scan then upgraded 88 non-actor scripts to `Actor`. Its function set
  shared 14 entries with `_OBJREF_SHARED_FUNCTIONS` (`GetDistance` alone hit
  101 scripts), it matched inside comments and string literals, it matched
  locals *named* like functions, and it matched actor-only calls inside
  `OnEquipped`-style events whose subject is the passed-in actor, not the item.
* **A script shared between an actor and a non-actor record.**
  `NoActivationScript` sits on both a DOOR and an NPC_. The scan returned on
  the first actor attachment, so every DOOR copy was unbound — and its empty
  `OnActivate`, which exists purely to *consume* the activation, never ran.
  The base type must now be one all attachments can bind.

Rules that follow:

* **Never widen `extends` for convenience.** It is not a cosmetic type change;
  it decides whether the script exists at runtime.
* **`_ACTOR_ONLY_FUNCTIONS` is not a sound test for "is this an actor".** It
  lists methods `ObjectReference` also declares — that is why
  `_OBJREF_SHARED_FUNCTIONS` exists (see also R3-5's `PlaceAtMe` trap). Any
  new consumer of it must subtract that set.
* **Read the Papyrus log for bind errors after a script-side change.**
  `grep -c "Unable to bind script"` is a one-line health check that no amount
  of compiling or record inspection replaces.

### GameHour is FLOAT — never truncate a global read (2026-07-28)

`GameHour` is FormID `0x00000038` in **both** games, and Skyrim declares it
**float** (`GLOB.FNAM=102`), so `GetValue()` returns fractional hours — 23.9847,
not 23. Oblivion mislabels it `short` in its own GLOB record but the engine still
reports the fraction, which is why the bell/chime idiom works there:

```
if ( GameHour >= 23.98 ) || ( GameHour <= 0.02 )   ; the top of the hour
```

Emitting `GameHour.GetValue() as Int` truncated that, and every such window
collapsed into an **always-true whole-hour test** (`23 >= 23.98` is false, but
`0 <= 0.02` is true for all of hour 0). The guarded body then ran every frame:
the Erodans-Kapelle chapel bell and Oblivion's `BellTowerScript` rang
continuously instead of once on the hour. 157 comparisons across 7 scripts in
both plugins.

- `_global_read()` decides the cast from the GLOB's real `FNAM.Type` (now carried
  by `CrossRefGraph.global_types`), plus an explicit `_FRACTIONAL_ENGINE_GLOBALS`
  set for engine globals Oblivion mislabels. `TimeScale` really is short
  (Skyrim `FNAM=115`) — do NOT add it.
- Assignments into Int variables still get their cast from
  `_coerce_float_to_int` (`GetValue` is in `_FLOAT_RETURNING_FUNCS`), so
  `currenthour = GameHour` remains correct.
- **General rule: a blanket cast on a global read is a silent behaviour change.**
  Type the cast from the record, not from the call site.

### The chime latch is REAL seconds vs a GAME-hour window (2026-07-30)

The `as Int` fix above was necessary but **not sufficient** — the bell still rang
on repeat in Nehrim. The guard was fixed; the *latch* was not.

The idiom is a one-shot latch. The GameHour window sets `soundplaying = 1`, and a
countdown holds the latch until it passes a negative sentinel:

```
if ( soundplaying == 1 )
    set timer to ( timer - GetSecondsPassed )
    if ( timer <= -5 )              ; REAL seconds
        set soundplaying to 0
```

The window is measured in **game hours**; the sentinel in **real seconds**. The
two only stay in step at the TimeScale the author used:

| TimeScale | 1 game hour | 0.04gh window | 5s latch | rings/hour |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 30 (Oblivion) | 120s | **4.8s** | outlasts it | 1 ✓ |
| 10 (**Nehrim**) | 360s | **14.4s** | expires 2× *inside* the window | 3 ✗ |
| 5 | 720s | 28.8s | expires 5× inside | 6 ✗ |

Nehrim ships `TimeScale = 10` (GLOB `0x3A`; Oblivion ships 30), so the latch
clears while `GameHour` is *still* inside the window and immediately re-fires.
**This is not a Papyrus artifact** — Oblivion's own interpreter rings 3× per hour
at TimeScale 10. The scripts were only ever correct at the author's TimeScale.

- `_scaled_debounce_seconds()` widens the sentinel to `window * 1.25` whenever
  the authored value no longer outlasts the window, and **returns it untouched
  when it already does** — so TimeScale-30 output is byte-identical (verified:
  `TES4_BellTowerScript.psc` diffs clean, 0 Oblivion scripts widened).
- Gated on `_uses_hour_window` (the `GameHour >= X.98` idiom) so ordinary timers
  keep their authored durations; `_LATCH_EXPIRY_RE` only matches a `<= -N`
  sentinel, never `<= 0` or a `>=` test.
- `CrossRefGraph.global_values` now carries GLOB `FLTV` values, so the converter
  can read the plugin's *own* TimeScale rather than assuming 30.
- Measured with `temp/bell_sim.py`: Nehrim 3.0 -> 1.0 rings/game-hour, Oblivion
  unchanged at 1.0.
- **General rule: a TES4 constant in real seconds that gates on game time is
  only valid at the author's TimeScale.** Scale it, don't copy it.
- **This was NOT the cause of the reported "bells on infinite repeat."** It is a
  real defect and the fix stands, but the chapel bell had a separate cause — see
  the next section. Do not re-litigate the latch when a bell repeats.

### `Begin OnTrigger` is PER-FRAME, not on-entry (2026-07-30)

The chapel bell that "tolls ~12 times, breaks briefly, then tolls again forever"
is **not** `SoundZoneKapelleGlockenScript` at all, and not a sound-record loop
(`SNDX.Flags=0`, emitted `LNAM=00000000` — verified in the built ESM).

Two facts have to land together:

1. **`fx\nehrim\kapelleglocke.wav` is 15.46 s long and contains a full peal of
   ~12 tolls.** "12 tolls" is ONE `Play()` call, not twelve. Measure the asset
   before treating a count of anything as a loop count.
2. The bell is rung by nine `Magieverbot*` (magic-ban) scripts, not the chapel
   script — `AAKapelleGlocken` is referenced by **10** Nehrim scripts. It is an
   *alarm* bell for casting inside Erothin's no-magic zone.

Those scripts are `Begin OnTrigger Player` blocks, and **TES4 runs an
`OnTrigger` block every frame the object is inside the volume.** The block's own
code proves it: it counts `frame >= 25` and `frame >= 100` *executions* as a
cooldown. Converting it to Papyrus `OnTriggerEnter` — which fires once, on entry
— froze the state machine on `counter == 1`, so the 100-frame cooldown never
ran and the alarm re-fired on every re-evaluation.

- Skyrim keeps the same three-way split, and all three are distinct engine
  events (`OnTrigger`, `OnTriggerEnter`, `OnTriggerLeave` each appear once,
  NUL-terminated, in `SkyrimSE.exe`). `ObjectReference.psc` documents
  `OnTrigger` as "a trigger is tripped" versus "volume is entered/left".
- `TES4_BLOCK_MAP` now sends `ontrigger`, `ontriggeractor` and `ontriggermob`
  to `Event OnTrigger`. The latter two differ only in *what* trips them, not in
  edge-vs-repeat; Skyrim has no actor/creature split, so that filter stays in
  the body.
- Scope: **504 blocks** (Nehrim 317, Oblivion 187); 79 of them keep a
  per-execution counter and were therefore hard-frozen. Verified no script
  declares two blocks that would now collide into a duplicate `Event OnTrigger`
  (0 in both plugins), and both plugins compile clean.
- **General rule: check whether a TES4 block is edge-triggered or per-frame
  before picking the Papyrus event.** A body that counts its own executions is
  proof of per-frame.
- This is a real defect and the fix stands, but it was **not** the cause of the
  looping chapel bell either. See below.

#### …but the ENTRY frame still has to fire — emit BOTH (2026-08-05, in-game confirmed)

Keeping the body on `OnTrigger` is right, but it is not sufficient: **Skyrim does
not deliver `OnTrigger` for a fast crossing**, which is exactly what walking over
a tripwire or a pressure plate is. Stepping on the Vilverin plate did nothing at
all — the body never ran once.

The vanilla census is unanimous and settles it: `Tripwire.pex`,
`PressurePlate.pex`, `TrapTriggerBase.pex` and `TrapTriggerHinge.pex` **all**
define `OnTriggerEnter`, and vanilla's own `Tripwire` does **not** define
`OnTrigger` at all. (Read them with `skyrim_assets.get_asset_bytes('scripts/
<Name>.pex')` and grep the string table for `On*` — the .psc sources are not
shipped.)

So a converted `begin OnTrigger` block now emits **both** events: the body stays
in `Event OnTrigger` (repeat semantics preserved, Magieverbot counters still
work) and a generated `Event OnTriggerEnter` delegates to it for the crossing
frame:

```papyrus
Event OnTriggerEnter(ObjectReference akActionRef)
  OnTrigger(akActionRef)
EndEvent
```

- Scope: **187 Oblivion scripts**. Skipped when the script authors its own
  `OnTriggerEnter` block (Papyrus allows one definition per event; 0 Oblivion
  scripts do, but a third-party plugin may).
- **Do not "simplify" this back to a single event.** Remapping to
  `OnTriggerEnter` alone re-freezes the per-frame counters above; leaving it on
  `OnTrigger` alone means trap triggers never fire. Both are required.

<a id="one-trigger-at-a-time"></a>**One OnTrigger at a time (2026-09-25, confirmed
in game).** TES4 finished each frame's `OnTrigger` before the next frame's began.
Papyrus gives every event its own thread, and a thread waiting on a game call
lets the next event in. So a one-time block whose `set doOnce to 1` comes after
a slow call ran once for EVERY overlapping event. Nehrim's
`StartCelleAufzugTriggerZone01Script` (the intro lift) hit this: its
`Autosave` + `DoOnce` block made about 7 saves in 2 seconds (counted from
TESRuntime's `journal: saved` line, which logs once per game save). The result
was a multi-second stutter as the lift started. The body now lives in
`Function TES4_OnTriggerBody`, and the event skips while a `TES4_TriggerBusy`
flag is set. It is a function so that a TES4 `return` inside the body still
clears the flag. After the fix, the same run made one autosave.

### Physical-trap damage: TES4's ENGINE read the script's variables (2026-08-09, in-game confirmed)

A converted swinging mace, swinging log, falling log or cave-in fired, swung
and connected — and dealt **zero damage**. Nothing in the TES4 script explains
it, because **the damage is not in the script**: Oblivion's engine dealt it.

When a Havok body on layer 14 (`OL_TRAP`) struck an actor, TES4 read three
magic variables off the striking object's script and applied
`fTrapDamage + fLevelledDamage × victimLevel` damage plus `fTrapPushBack`:

| TES4 script variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `fTrapDamage` | flat damage |
| `fLevelledDamage` | per-victim-level damage coefficient |
| `fTrapPushBack` | knockback impulse |
| `fTrapMinVelocity` | contact speed floor (NOT converted — see below) |
| `bTrapContinuous` | re-hit while in contact (NOT converted) |

The names are a **convention the engine keys on**, not ordinary locals — the
script body never assigns damage anywhere. `CTrapSwingMace01SCRIPT` sets
`fTrapDamage 20 / fLevelledDamage 1.5` on activation, which is exactly UESP's
documented "20 + 1.5 × level" for the swinging mace; the swinging log's 15 and
the falling logs' 30 match their scripts the same way. Census:
`fTrapDamage` appears in **226 Oblivion and 127 Nehrim** scripts.

**Skyrim keeps the detection but moves the damage into the script.** The
layer-14 contact still fires — it arrives as the `OnTrapHitStart` script event
— and vanilla answers it in `TrapHitBase.psc` with the native
`ObjectReference.ProcessTrapHit`. So the conversion mirrors vanilla's contract:
every converted `ObjectReference`/`Actor` script that DECLARES `fTrapDamage`
gets a synthesized handler.

```papyrus
Event OnTrapHitStart(ObjectReference akTarget, float afXVel, float afYVel, \
    float afZVel, float afXPos, float afYPos, float afZPos, int aeMaterial, \
    bool abInitialHit, int aeMotionType)
  Actor victim = akTarget as Actor
  If victim == None
    Return
  EndIf
  Float totalDamage = fTrapDamage + fLevelledDamage * victim.GetLevel()
  If totalDamage <= 0.0
    Return   ; not armed yet - TES4 variables start at 0
  EndIf
  akTarget.ProcessTrapHit(Self, totalDamage, fTrapPushBack, afXVel, afYVel, \
      afZVel, afXPos, afYPos, afZPos, aeMaterial, 0.0)
EndEvent
```

- **Read the variables LIVE, never bake the numbers in.** Doing so reproduces
  the whole authored lifecycle for free: the mace script leaves `fTrapDamage`
  at 0 while the trap is armed and held (so brushing it is harmless), sets 20
  on release, and drops it to 5 six seconds later. The `<= 0.0` guard is what
  makes the held phase safe, and it is why an un-triggered trap does nothing.
- Only `fLevelledDamage`/`fTrapPushBack` that the script actually declares are
  referenced; a script with `fTrapDamage` alone emits the flat term only.
- Scope: **64 Oblivion + 33 Nehrim** scripts (maces, swinging/falling logs,
  cave-ins, spike pits, blades, gas emitters).
- `fTrapMinVelocity` and `bTrapContinuous` are deliberately **not** converted.
  The event's velocity units are unverified, and gating on a wrong threshold
  silences all damage — the exact failure being fixed. `OnTrapHitStart` fires
  per contact-start rather than per frame, which already approximates the
  non-continuous case.
- The collision side needed no change: `_remap_world_filter` passes authored
  layer 14 straight through, and vanilla agrees — `trapmace01`'s striking mace
  head is layer 14 while its chain links are layer 10.
- **General rule: when a TES4 feature has no code behind it, suspect an engine
  convention keyed on variable names.** Grepping the script for "damage" finds
  nothing; the census of variable NAMES across all scripts is what exposes it.
- Pinned by `tests/test_script_converter.py::TestPhysicalTrapDamage` — including
  the two cases that would not compile if the emission were naive: a script
  declaring `fTrapDamage` alone must not reference the variables it lacks, and a
  Quest script must get no handler at all (`OnTrapHitStart` is an
  `ObjectReference` event).

### Engine globals must bind UNSHIFTED (2026-07-30) — the actual bell bug

**Root cause of the endlessly-looping chapel bell**, found in `Papyrus.0.log`
after two wrong theories (the TimeScale latch and `OnTrigger`, both above):

```
error: Property Gamehour on script TES4_SoundZoneKapelleGlockenScript
attached to (1A20DD0F) cannot be bound because <nullptr form> (1A000038)
is not the right type
error: Cannot call GetValue() on a None object, aborting function call
	[ (1A20DD0F)].TES4_SoundZoneKapelleGlockenScript.OnUpdate()
```

`convert_GLOB` deliberately drops the engine-owned globals (`GameHour`,
`TimeScale`, …) because Skyrim already ships them — and at the **same FormIDs
Oblivion uses** (`GameYear 0x35` … `TimeScale 0x3A`, verified in both GLOB
dumps). But the VMAD property binders still ran those FormIDs through the
load-order remap, producing `1A000038` — a form that does not exist. The
property bound to **None**, so `GameHour.GetValue()` returned **0.0 forever**,
which is permanently inside every `GameHour <= 0.02` hour-boundary window. The
bell re-fired on a continuous loop.

The `constants.py` comment claimed these references "are canonicalized to the
vanilla forms by script_convert (`_GLOBAL_CANONICAL`)". That was **false** —
`_GLOBAL_CANONICAL` only canonicalizes the *name*; nothing ever fixed the
FormID, and `_ENGINE_GLOBALS` had exactly one use (dropping the record). A
documented mechanism that does not exist in the source is worse than none.

- `constants.ENGINE_GLOBAL_FORMIDS` maps the six engine globals to their vanilla
  FormIDs. All three VMAD binders now bind them unshifted, exactly like Player
  (`0x14`): `object_scripts._resolve_props`,
  `dialog_converter._build_info_script_properties`, and
  `dialog_converter._collect_scro_properties` (the SCRO path shifted them too).
- Scope: **338 bindings** repaired (Nehrim 113, Oblivion 225); 0 remain shifted
  in either plugin.
- **Why "~12 chimes" is not a bug**: `fx\nehrim\kapelleglocke.wav` is a 15.46 s
  recording of exactly 12 evenly-spaced strikes (1.24 s apart, measured). Nehrim
  has only one bell asset and the script never counts hours — it plays the same
  12-strike file at every hour. That is vanilla Nehrim behaviour, not a
  conversion artifact. Making it strike the hour would be a redesign.
- **General rule: any FormID shared with the engine must skip the load-order
  remap.** Player was special-cased; the globals were not. When a property reads
  None in-game, check the Papyrus log for the binding error *first* — it names
  the exact FormID and costs one grep, versus days of modelling script logic.

### Synthesized records were unbound on object scripts (2026-07-31)

Same failure mode as the engine-globals bug above — a property binding to
**None** — from the opposite cause, and it survived that fix because it lives on
a different code path.

The converter mints properties for records that exist only in the OUTPUT:
`TES4Fame`, `TES4Infamy`, `TES4GoldFenced`, the crime realm list
`TES4CrimeFactions` (once `TES4CyrodiilCrimeFaction`), and the
`TES4Unlock_*` topic gates. `object_scripts._resolve_props` binds properties
through `resolve_property_formid()` → `xref.edid_to_formid`, which is built
**from the TES4 export** and therefore can never contain a synthesized record.
Every one silently resolved to nothing.

Only the **object-script** binder was affected: `dialog_converter` already
injects the same registry as `well_known_props`, so `QF_*`/`TIF_*` fragments
bound correctly — which is why a verification counting the 4,762 *dialogue*
bindings reported all-clear while every object script was broken.

- `synth_records.WELL_KNOWN_PROPERTIES` is the registry, imported directly by
  `object_scripts`. `_resolve_props` consults it before falling through to the
  EditorID lookup.
- Worst case found: `TGStolenGoodsScript`, the **Thieves Guild rank driver** —
  all ten of its gates read `TES4GoldFenced.GetValue()`, so a None property
  threw on the first tick and no TG rank ever advanced.
- **General rule: a record the importer synthesizes needs an explicit binding
  route in EVERY VMAD binder.** The export-derived EditorID map cannot see it.
  Check with `python tools/script/vmad_probe.py <esm> <script> --props` — a property the
  `.psc` declares but the probe does not list is unbound.

### An early `return` killed the OnUpdate poll (2026-07-31)

TES4 `return` ends only **this frame's** `GameMode` pass; the script runs again
next frame. The converted `OnUpdate` is one-shot and self-rescheduling, so a
`Return` that falls past the trailing `RegisterForSingleUpdate` stops the script
**for the rest of the game**.

`if GetStage X < N / return` is a standard Oblivion early-out, so this was
widespread: **115 Returns across 96 scripts**, including quest drivers
(`MG01`/`MG02`/`MG05`/`MG06`/`MG08`/`MG12`/`MG17`/`MG18`, `MQ16Script`,
`MS04`/`MS09`/`MS14`). `MG05RockScript` fires one shock bolt per tick and uses
`return` to serialize six — it fired exactly one bolt, ever.

The poll is armed at three places, each for a different reason (2026-08-16):

* **top of `OnUpdate`: `RegisterForSingleUpdate(5.0)` — abort insurance
  ONLY.** A runtime error mid-body aborts the event; without this the poll
  died for the rest of the game. 🛑 It must NOT be the real interval:
  `RegisterForSingleUpdate` counts from *now*, so a top arm at `interval`
  starts the next pass `interval` after this one **started**, and a pass whose
  body takes longer than that (MQ01Script's tutorial poll does ~15 latent
  natives per 0.1s tick) overlaps itself; each overlap slows the VM, and the
  pile grows without bound. Measured in game (Papyrus stack dump at the start
  of CharacterGen): **251 concurrent `TES4_MQ01Script.OnUpdate` stacks**, End
  fragments of 1–2s lines running 19–24s late, conversations with 10s+ gaps
  and repeated lines. That was the "excruciating" prison scene.
* **every TES4 `return` in the body**: `RegisterForSingleUpdate(<interval>)`
  spliced before `Return` (`_poll_return_prefix`), `Is3DLoaded()`-gated for
  object/actor scripts. A value-returning `Return <x>` (OBSE user function) is
  not touched; the `!IsRunning()` guard keeps the 5s insurance (a quest that
  is not running need not poll faster); the dialogue gate re-arms at 0.5s.
* **bottom of the body: `RegisterForSingleUpdate(<interval>)`** — the cadence,
  measured from the END of the pass, so passes never overlap.

### `begin MenuMode` — the BARE form is not the menu-ID form (2026-07-31)

The two spellings look alike and behave completely differently, and conflating
them costs real quest logic in one direction or a stage blowout in the other.

* **`begin MenuMode <id>`** fires only while that one menu is open (1014 =
  lockpicking, 1030 = class menu, 1002 = inventory). Skyrim has no per-menu
  hook, so these **must not run**: MQ01's id'd blocks `setstage MQ01 70`/`84`
  unconditionally, and merging them into the poll blew the tutorial's whole
  stage machine on the first tick, then hit stage 100's `stopquest MQ01`.
* **`begin MenuMode`** (bare) fires on *every* menu frame. Censused over
  Oblivion.esm, **not one of the 20 bare blocks is a menu-specific trigger** —
  they are all time-and-inventory bookkeeping that runs on the frames where
  GameMode does *not*, i.e. wait/sleep and the inventory screen. Several say so
  in their own comments (`ErthorScript`: *"contingency if player is
  waiting/resting"*; `SE02OrcCaptainScript` guards on `isTimePassing`).

Dropping the bare bodies deleted the **only** writer of two quest flags:
`MelisandeScript`'s `set MS40.cureready to 1` (so MS40's vampirism cure could
never be handed over) and `Dark09RetirementScript`'s `set GotFinger to 1`. Also
lost: the 7 innkeeper rent timers, 195 lines of SE37 item checks, and
`GandredhelScript`'s topic reveal.

The faithful conversion is to **merge a bare, non-sleep MenuMode body into the
GameMode poll** at its source position — in Oblivion the pair together covered
every frame, so one always-running pass reproduces the union rather than half of
it. `_has_gamemode` must account for it too, or a script whose only block is a
bare MenuMode (`SE42Script`, `DAOghmaInfiniumScript`) gets no loop at all.

Two exceptions keep their own routes: the `isPCSleeping` idiom becomes
`OnSleepStart`/`OnSleepStop`, and menu-ID blocks take the route below.

### <a id="menumode-with-a-menu-id"></a>`begin MenuMode <id>` → `OnMenuClose`

The blanket "menu-ID blocks stay commented" rule above cost a real quest. FNV's
`VCG01` — Doc Mitchell's opening — parks forever at stage 36:

* INFO `00104BF8` ("How'd I do?") ends with `SetStage VCG01 36`.
* Stage 36's entire body is `ShowRaceMenu` (the reflectron).
* Stage 37 is an empty placeholder: *"set when the player leaves menu mode"*.
* Stage 40 is `DocMitchellREF.SayTo player VCG01Intro` — Doc resuming.

Nothing in the quest data advances 36 → 40. The only writer is `VCG01SCRIPT`:

```
BEGIN menumode 1036
	if getstage VCG01 == 36
		setstage VCG01 40
	endif
END
```

Commented out, the race menu opens and Doc never speaks again.

SKSE is a required install, so `RegisterForMenu` / `OnMenuClose` are available
and a mapped id gets a **real listener**. TES4 ran the body every frame the menu
was up; the observable Skyrim moment is the close, so the body runs once there.
That is the right beat for both known 1036 users — FNV advances a stage *after*
the player is done, and Nehrim's `CharGenQuest` accumulates a "long in the
character designer" achievement timer.

**Menu-ID mapping**, `MENU_ID_NAMES` in `constants.py`. The menu-name string is
copied verbatim from `SkyrimSE.exe` (note the space in `RaceSex Menu`):

| TES4/FNV id | Skyrim menu | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 1036 | `RaceSex Menu` | FNV stage 36 calls `ShowRaceMenu`; Nehrim's block feeds `LongInCharacterDesigner` |

**The map holds only ids whose body is safe to run on a close**, which is why it
has one entry rather than the six the menu-name table would allow. 1014
(lockpicking) is the counter-example: MQ01Script's `begin MenuMode 1014` is
`setstage MQ01 70`, and firing that the first time the player closes *any*
lockpick still blows the tutorial through its stage machine — the same defect as
merging it into the GameMode poll, just later. An id earns a row only when its
bodies across the corpus are genuinely "the player finished with this menu"
logic. Everything unmapped keeps the comment treatment: converted so a hand-port
only has to supply the hook, but never executed.

Census of filtered blocks (`begin MenuMode <id>`) across the three plugins —
Nehrim 1008×49, 1012×2, 1007×2, 1036, 1044, 1033, 1039; FalloutNV 1001×15,
1012×3, 1056×2, 1008, 1009; Oblivion 1023×2, 1034×2, 1012, 1040, 1002, 1022,
1014, 1030. Nehrim's 1008×49 is one script's per-menu bookkeeping, not 49
triggers.

Before merging, check the bodies are safe on an ordinary frame. All 20 are
idempotent state machines gated by their own doonce/stage variables; a merged
body that reads a menu (`DAOghmaInfiniumScript`'s `getbuttonpressed`) is safe
because the read is consume-once (see the button-MessageBox section below):
until its own box has been shown and clicked it reads -1, so no branch
matches. Where a body is duplicated in both blocks (the `Publican*` rent
counter), running both in one pass still advances the hour once — the first
copy rewrites `renthour` to `GameHour`, so the second's
`(renthour + 1) < GameHour` is false.

### Button MessageBoxes become authored MESG records (2026-08-03)

TES4 builds every in-world choice menu as `MessageBox "text" "Btn1" "Btn2"`
plus a `GetButtonPressed` poll in GameMode. Skyrim has no dynamic boxes, so
for years both halves were stubbed — the box lost its buttons
(`Debug.MessageBox`) and the poll read a constant `-1` — which left ~289
menus dead across the plugins, including two that **soft-locked chargen**:
Oblivion's `CGSewerExitScript` ("Finished - Exit Sewers" is the dead
`button == 3` branch that sets MQ01 stage 88) and Morroblivion's
`mwCGCensusExitDootScript` (same shape, `fbmwChargen` stage 100).

The real conversion (`script_convert/message_menus.py` is the shared plan
both sides run):

* the **importer** writes one MESG per call site — EDID
  `TES4Msg_<Script>_<NN>`, DESC = text, one ITXT per trailing quoted string,
  DNAM bit 0 — and registers the EDIDs in `_WELL_KNOWN_PROPERTIES` so VMAD
  property binding resolves them;
* the **converter** emits `TES4_MsgButton = TES4_ShowMsg(TES4Msg_X_NN)` at
  the call site and `TES4_TakeMsgButton()` for `GetButtonPressed`.
  `TES4_ShowMsg` clears the state before `Show()` (TES4: displaying a box
  resets GetButtonPressed to -1), `Show()` parks its thread on the box, and
  the take helper returns the clicked index once, then -1 — TES4's own
  contract, which is what keeps `if button == N` polls from re-firing on a
  stale index.

Sites are matched by (text, buttons) content, not position — MenuMode merges
can reorder blocks. A `GetButtonPressed` in a script that never shows a
button box of its own (cross-script polling of TES4's global button state —
a handful of sites) still reads `-1`, explicitly dead rather than miswired.
Format specifiers inside a button-box's text (`"...%.0f Drakes?" cost "Yes"
"No"`) survive literally: MESG DESC is static text.

### A modal menu in a POLLED body must block the whole pass (2026-08-15)

`ShowBirthsignMenu` / `ShowClassMenu` convert to a `Message.Show()` chain
(`message_menus.build_chargen_menus`). TES4's chargen menus were modal to the
**entire GameMode pass**: the statement written after `ShowBirthsignMenu` did
not run until the player had chosen. Papyrus only parks *the thread that
called* `Show()`, so the poll's next tick — 0.1s later, on another thread —
re-enters the same body **while the menu is still open**.

A re-entrancy latch alone is not enough. The first form latched the menu but
let the latched-out pass **fall through to the authored tail**, which for
CharacterGen ran `setstage 44` mid-menu. Stage 44's fragment force-greets the
Emperor (`UrielSeptimRef.evp`) at a player still locked in the menu, so the
greet is evaluated and consumed with nobody able to receive it: the menu
closes onto an Emperor with nothing pending, and chargen soft-locks with the
player free-roaming mid-scene.

Verified live through the game bridge rather than by reading: driving
`setstage charactergen 43` advanced the stage to 44 **instantly** while
`TES4ChargenBirthsignChoice` was still 0 — the menu had not yet returned a
choice. That single readback is what separated this from the (superficially
identical) "menu shows twice" symptom the latch was originally added for.

So the emission is **context-dependent**:

* **Polled body** (`_current_event == 'Event OnUpdate()'`) — a latched-out
  pass `Return`s. The tick defers entirely; the pass that owns the menu runs
  the authored tail itself once `Show()` returns. Safe because the poll
  re-arms at the TOP of `OnUpdate`, so returning cannot kill the loop.
* **One-shot site** (quest-stage fragment, `OnActivate`) — keeps the
  fall-through `If !busy` form. Nothing repeating re-enters it, so the latch
  can only trip on a genuine race, and there a `Return` would **drop** the
  authored tail rather than defer it.

The general rule: when a converted call blocks, ask whether its caller
repeats. A `Return` is only correct where something will call again.

### <a id="chargen-menu-reopens-the-dialogue"></a>A chargen menu closes the dialogue it opened from; the partner must re-greet at once

**Code:** `commands.chargen_menu`, `TES4Polyfill.DialogueSpeaker`.

CharacterGen stage 87: Baurus's class-guess line ends, its End fragment sets
stage 87, the stage fragment opens the class menu, the player picks, and
Baurus restarts the conversation only after a long delay. The quest reads 87
meanwhile, and 88 (the completion stage, set only by the four `CGBaurusI`
INFOs) is unreachable until he does.

What the records say:

* Stage 87's TES4 result script is **only** `showclassmenu`. Everything the
  section above once credited to it (`MQ02.SetStage(10/20)`, the topic
  unlocks, the autosave) is stage **88**.
* Oblivion authored the re-greet itself: `CGBaurusToPlayerB` (`0001EC0F`) is a
  player-targeted Ambush gated `GetStage CharacterGen == 87`, beside
  `CGBaurusToPlayerA` gated `== 86`. TES4's modal menu sat over a dialogue that
  stayed open; ToPlayerB is the fallback for a player who left it.
* Skyrim's `Message.Show()` closes the dialogue menu. The CK wiki's ForceGreet
  procedure "completes after the actor says the line and exits dialogue", and
  the package stack is otherwise re-evaluated only **periodically** — so
  Baurus sits on the finished ToPlayerA until the engine's next evaluation,
  and only then runs ToPlayerB (`fAIForceGreetingTimer` = 3.0s after that).
  The birthsign path never showed this because stage 44's authored
  `UrielSeptimRef.evp` re-evaluates the Emperor the moment the menu closes.

The conversion supplies the evp TES4 did not need. `chargen_menu` captures
`TES4Polyfill.DialogueSpeaker()` before `Show()` — the actor whose line last
played in the player's dialogue menu, from the Variable05/06 stamp
`LineBegan` writes on the player (`Actor.GetDialogueTarget()` is documented to
return None on the player) — and calls `EvaluatePackage()` on it after the
menu. At a polled site (the birthsign menu) the poll only runs once
`PlayerIsInDialogue()` is false, which has cleared the stamp, so the call is a
no-op and that path is byte-identical to before.

Reverted on the way here: a `ReleaseSpokenLine()` polyfill that cleared the
speaking latch before `Show()`. Emitted at every chargen-menu site it fired
inside polled bodies mid-line and stopped actors finishing their lines
game-wide; its theory (the modal swallowing the End fragment) was also wrong —
the End fragment is what opens the menu.

### A "no equivalent → 0" fallback can shadow a working handler (2026-07-31)
<a id="no-equivalent-fallback-shadows-handler"></a>

`_convert_expression` keeps a list of argument-less commands that have no Skyrim
equivalent and returns the literal `'0'` for them. Two entries on that list
**also had real handlers** in `_emit_function` — and because those commands take
no arguments they are *always* read bare, so the fallback always won and the
handler was unreachable dead code.

* **`IsPCAMurderer`** → `If 0 == 1`. `DarkBrotherhoodScript`'s site is the sole
  trigger for the entire Dark Brotherhood questline, so Lucien Lachance never
  appeared and `Dark01Knife` never started.
* **`GetDetectionLevel`** → 56 dead threshold tests, including all 7 of
  `Dark04ExecutionScript`'s guard-aggro triggers and the Dark Sanctuary
  assassins' reaction to the player.

The lesson generalises: **before adding a command to a "no equivalent" list,
grep for an existing handler**, and before trusting one that is already there,
check whether the command's arity lets the handler be reached at all. A flat `0`
is invisible — it compiles, it never warns, and the call site quietly becomes a
constant.

When flattening *is* right, it must still be justified by how call sites read
the value. `GetDetectionLevel` was defensible only if scripts read the level
numerically; censused over the plugin, **not one of the 56 sites does** — every
one is `>= 2`, `>= 3` or `== 3`, i.e. "is the target detected", which
`IsDetectedBy` answers exactly.

### A compound `player.X` entry can shadow a handler too (2026-08-02)
<a id="compound-playerx-shadows-handler"></a>

Same family as above, different mechanism. `_emit_function` short-cuts any
`ref.func` whose **compound** key (`player.moveto`) exists in `FUNCTION_MAP`,
returning before the dedicated handler further down. `_COMPOUND_HAS_OWN_HANDLER`
exempts commands that need the handler; only `placeatme` was listed.

`moveto` needed the exemption for three reasons:

1. The compound path routes args through `_convert_args`, which **splits on
   commas only** — Oblivion writes the offsets space-separated
   (`MoveTo marker 0 100 0`), so they glued onto the target name.
2. It never registers the destination as a property. The call then emitted a
   bare identifier that nothing declared, and the compiler rejected the **whole
   script**.
3. Only the `Player.`-prefixed form took that path, so a plain `ref.MoveTo`
   looked correct — which is exactly what hid the bug.

MoveTo's destination is a placed reference, so the handler now types it
`ObjectReference` (and skips `player`, a converter keyword that is never a
property, and any already-converted expression).

**Morroblivion symptom:** `CATChargenAndTransport` failed on
`Player.MoveTo CGPlayerStartMarker1`. Note the mod's own typo — no such marker
exists; the SCRO table binds only `CGPlayerStartMarker`, because Oblivion's
compiler treated the trailing `1` as MoveTo's optional offset argument. Oblivion
silently no-ops an unresolved target; Papyrus will not compile an undefined
name, so **one dead line in the mod took down the whole start-menu script**, and
with it the Imperial City transport.

### A script that fails to COMPILE takes its dependents down with it (2026-08-07)
<a id="compile-failure-takes-dependents-down"></a>

**Symptom:** Morroblivion's Fighters Guild handed out no quests after joining.
The Papyrus log named a *linking* failure, not a compile one:

```
Error: Unable to link type of variable "::fbmwFGAdvancement_var" on object
  "TES4_QF_fbmwFGKillBosses"
error: Unable to bind script TES4_QF_fbmwFGKillBosses to fbmwFGKillBosses (...)
  because their base types do not match
```

**The chain, and why the log points at the wrong file.** `TES4_QF_...KillBosses`
declares a property typed `TES4_fbmwFGAdvancementQuestScript`. That script
declares one typed `TES4_mwGetFactionWitnessesFunc` — which **failed to compile,
so no `.pex` was ever written**. A missing type cannot be linked, so the quest
script fails to load, so the QF fragment cannot bind, so **no stage fragment ever
runs**. Three files away from the error message.

The lesson generalises: **check `output/<plugin>/scripts/compile_errors.log`
before theorising about a dead quest.** One uncompilable script silently
disables every script that names its type, and the runtime error surfaces on the
dependent, never on the culprit.

`mwGetFactionWitnessesFunc` is called by **all nine** Morroblivion guild
advancement scripts, so a single unconvertible OBSE loop disabled every guild.

**What was actually wrong with it**, each fixed generically:

| Defect | Fix |
|---|---|
| OBSE `Label`/`Goto` ref-walk — not Papyrus keywords at all | `GetFirstRef 69`/`GetNextRef` → `Game.FindRandomActorFromRef` sampling; `Label` opens a `While`, `Goto` is a no-op (the header re-tests) |
| `GetIsGhost` / `GetUnconscious` unmapped (only the SETTERS were) | → `IsGhost()` / `IsUnconscious()` |
| `NextActor.IsCreature` — the dotted path resolves a name only if it is a `FUNCTION_MAP` key | added the `iscreature` alias beside `getiscreature` |
| `SetFunctionValue` with **no following `return`** | staged value inside a branch now returns where it stands — it was being dropped, making the function a constant `false` |
| `IsInFaction(Form)` — Papyrus wants a `Faction` | table-driven downcast at UDF call sites (`_UDF_ARG_DOWNCASTS`) |
| `_balance_if_endif` matched only a bare `function `, never `Int Function ...` | typed UDF bodies are now balanced too |

**Two parser bugs found alongside, both silent corruption rather than errors:**

- The arithmetic split ignored string literals, so `FileExists "Data\Morrowind_ob
  - Meshes.bsa"` split on the hyphen *inside the path* and leaked fragments out
  as code (`If 0 - Meshes.bsa(") == 0`).
- `_convert_args` split on whitespace regardless of quotes, so
  `IsModLoaded "Voice Overs V002.esp"` became three arguments and collapsed to a
  bare `If True` — firing every "deprecated plugin detected" warning
  unconditionally.

**Polarity matters when neutralising an install probe.** `FileExists` and
`GetModIndex` have no Papyrus answer, but every TES4 caller uses them to detect a
BROKEN install (`if FileExists ... == 0 → "ERROR: ... is missing"`). The paths
named are Oblivion-side BSAs and inis that do not exist after conversion *by
design*. Answering `0` fired every missing-file branch at once and greeted the
player with a bogus error box, so both answer the not-an-error side.

### `GetIsClass` / `GetPCIsClass` read the ActorBase (2026-08-02)

Both were **absent from `FUNCTION_MAP` entirely**, so the call survived
untranslated and Papyrus parsed `GetPCIsClass CharactergenClass` as a bare name
after a name — a syntax error that failed the whole script. Skyrim reads the
class off the ActorBase (`ActorBase.GetClass()`); `Actor` has no `GetClass()`.
The CLAS argument types as `Class`.

Site: Morroblivion's `fbmwChargenQuestScript` (the class quiz), which the
Chargen-and-Transport start menu imports — so the failure propagated to the
transport NPCs.

### A Bool cannot carry a multi-valued TES4 threshold (2026-07-31)
<a id="bool-cannot-carry-multivalued-threshold"></a>

Mapping `GetDetectionLevel` onto `IsDetectedBy` is only half the fix, and the
missing half fails *silently*. Papyrus rejects a bare `Bool >= 2` outright
(*"cannot relatively compare variables of type bool"*), so the generic
`_BOOL_CMP_RE` pass wraps it as `(... as Int) >= 2` — and **`true as Int` is 1**.
That compiles cleanly and is permanently false, so a naive mapping trades one
dead form for another while looking like a fix.

TES4 detection levels run 0 (unnoticed) to 3 (fully detected), so the emission
scales the Bool to the source's own top value:

```papyrus
((target.IsDetectedBy(observer) as Int) * 3)
```

0 or 3 satisfies every threshold the plugin uses (`== 3`, `>= 2`, `>= 3`)
exactly when detected and never otherwise. **Whenever a TES4 function with a
range wider than 0/1 is mapped onto a Papyrus Bool, rescale to the source's
range** — do not let the generic `as Int` cast decide, because it collapses the
range to 0/1 and quietly kills every threshold above 1.

### Skyrim has NO attributes — the AV tables share nothing (2026-08-06)
<a id="skyrim-has-no-attributes"></a>

**The two games' actor-value tables do not overlap at a single index.** TES4 0 is
Strength, TES5 0 is Aggression; TES4 5 is Endurance, TES5 5 is Assistance
(xEdit `wbActorValueEnum` in `wbDefinitionsTES4.pas` vs `wbDefinitionsTES5.pas`).
A CTDA `ptActorValue` param is a **raw index** into that table, so passing it
through unchanged reads a completely unrelated value.

Worse, Skyrim has no attributes at all. Strength, Intelligence, Willpower,
Agility, Speed, Endurance, Personality and Luck simply do not exist as actor
values, and no TES5 value is a faithful stand-in — every candidate (`SpeedMult`,
`HealRate`, `UnarmedDamage`, …) sits on a different scale, so a 0-100 attribute
threshold compared against one is arbitrary.

**This made every Morroblivion guild unjoinable.** Joining the Fighters Guild is
gated on `GetActorValue Strength >= 30 AND GetActorValue Endurance >= 30`
(INFO `013204F7`); converted verbatim that became `Aggression >= 30 AND
Assistance >= 30` — 0-3 enums that can never reach 30 at any level — so the
recruiter always fell through to *"The Fighters Guild can't just sign up anyone.
You don't meet our requirements."* The Thieves Guild (Agility/Personality →
Morality/One-Handed) failed identically, and the same defect hit ~600 conditions
across the exports. The script side had its own version: the polyfill aliased
`Strength → UnarmedDamage` (≈0, never passes) and `Agility → SpeedMult` (≈100,
always passes), so `fbmwFGAdvancementQuestScript`'s per-rank promotion gates were
equally dead.

The rule now, on **both** sides:

| TES4 AV | Conversion |
|---|---|
| The 8 attributes | **DROPPED** (CTDA) / stubbed to `100.0` (script read), writes discarded |
| Skills | Translated to the TES5 skill index / name |
| Shared derived + AI + magic values | Translated to the matching TES5 index |
| Everything else (Magicka Multiplier, Attack Bonus, Silence, Telekinesis, …) | Dropped — no TES5 equivalent |

Dropping an attribute gate **fails OPEN**, which is the faithful outcome: the
gate exists to keep an under-developed character out, and a Skyrim character has
no way to raise an attribute, so enforcing it would lock the content away
*permanently* rather than merely early.

Three places must agree, and a change to one needs the same change in the others:
`tes5_import/base/conditions.py` (`_TES4_AV_ATTRIBUTES` / `_TES4_AV_TO_TES5`,
applied in `convert_ctda` for functions 14 `GetActorValue` and 277
`GetBaseActorValue`), `script_convert/constants.py` (`TES4_ATTRIBUTES`,
`ATTRIBUTE_STUB_VALUE`, `ACTOR_VALUE_MAP`), and
`script_convert/static_scripts/TES4Polyfill.psc` (`IsTES4Attribute`).

Two AV names the map used to emit — `LuckModifier` and `MuteModifier` — are **not
names the engine knows** (verified against `SkyrimSE.exe`'s AV name table, which
runs `…Blindness, WeaponSpeedMult…` with no silence entry), so every read
returned 0 and every write was rejected. Skyrim's internal names for two skills
are also *not* the UI names: use `Speechcraft` (not Speech) and `Marksman` (not
Archery) in Papyrus strings; the CTDA side uses the numeric indices 17 and 8.

### Aggression/Confidence are ENUMS in TES5, not 0-100 (2026-07-28)
<a id="aggression-confidence-are-enums"></a>

TES4 stores the AI traits on a 0-100 scale; TES5 defines them as small enums
(xEdit `wbDefinitionsCommon.pas`: `wbAggressionEnum` 0-3, `wbConfidenceEnum` 0-4,
`wbAssistanceEnum` 0-2, Morality 0-3). `SetActorValue("Aggression", 100)` is
**rejected outright** — the engine logs *"attempt made to set illegal value"* and
leaves the trait **unchanged**, so every scripted "now turn hostile" beat
silently did nothing. 160 such writes in Nehrim alone (94 of them `Aggression
100`), 509 enum-AV writes across both plugins.

`_scale_enum_av()` buckets literals onto the same thresholds the record-side
converter uses (`tes5_import/record_types/actors.py`), so a scripted change lands
on the tier the NPC's AIDT was converted to. Values already inside the enum range
pass through untouched; non-literals are left alone. `ModActorValue` is
deliberately NOT scaled — a delta on a 0-100 scale has no enum equivalent, and no
such call exists in the source. Verify with
grep the generated sources for `Set/ForceActorValue` on the enum AVs
(`check_enum_actor_values.py` did this; removed 2026-08-25).

#### Aggression must not collapse 6..105 onto tier 2 (fixed 2026-07-31)

**TES4 aggression is only half of a PER-TARGET rule**; TES5's is a GLOBAL tier.
UESP `Oblivion:Aggression`: an actor attacks a target when
`disposition(actor→target) < aggression - 5`, so ≤5 never attacks and ≥106
attacks anyone regardless of disposition. TES5 instead names *which reaction
class* the actor attacks (UESP `Skyrim:NPCs#Aggression`): 0 nobody, 1 Enemies,
**2 Enemies AND NEUTRALS**, 3 everyone.

The old rule was `0 if raw <= 5 else (3 if raw >= 106 else 2)` — everything from
6 to 105 became tier 2. **The player is a Neutral to most factions**, so any
scripted "wake up and join this fight" turned the actor hostile to the player.

CharacterGen stage 22 is the case that exposed it: `GlenroyRef.setav aggression
10` exists so the Emperor's guards respond to the Mythic Dawn ambush. In Oblivion
10 only beats a disposition below 5, and the guards' disposition toward the
player is ≈47, so they never turn on you. Converted to tier 2 they attacked the
player from stage 22 onward — the exact failure UESP describes: *"a guard would
attack the whole town if their aggression were sufficiently raised."*

The threshold is `_ONSIGHT_AGGRESSION = 65`, matching the record path's margin
test (a default actor with disposition ≈ Personality 50 needs `(aggr-5) - 50 >=
10`, i.e. aggression ≥ 65 before it earns tier 2):

| TES4 `setav aggression` | tier | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| ≤ 5 | 0 | never initiates |
| 6 – 64 | **1** | attacks declared Enemies only — the faction graph picks the opponent |
| 65 – 105 | 2 | attacks Neutrals on sight too |
| ≥ 106 | 3 | Frenzied |

Census of the 227 scripted calls in Oblivion.esm: 38 → tier 0, **78 → tier 1**
(values 10/20/25/30/40/50, previously all tier 2), 111 → tier 2 (70/80/90/100,
the genuine "now attack anyone" beats). Keep this table in step with
`_npc_aidt` in `tes5_import/record_types/actors.py`, which applies the same rule
to base records but subtracts disposition explicitly.

Two recurring shapes, both found in the animation handlers:

- **Wrong target vocabulary.** The emitted call is valid Papyrus but the string
  argument comes from TES4's namespace, which the engine silently drops.
  `PlayIdle`/`PickIdle` passes the raw TES4 IDLE EditorID straight into
  `Debug.SendAnimationEvent(ref, "<edid>")`; Skyrim defines no such event, so the
  idle never plays and nothing is logged (`"fastforward"` survives into output
  this way, next to correctly-mapped events like `moveStart`).
- **Unconditional target-type assumption.** *The correct API depends on WHAT THE
  TARGET IS, not on whether the call names a reference.* `PlayGroup` routed every
  explicit-ref call to `Debug.SendAnimationEvent` (behavior-graph actors only), so
  `CGPrisonSecretWallRef.playgroup forward 1` — an ACTI whose NIF carries a
  `Forward` NiControllerSequence — did nothing and Renault's switch never moved
  the wall, while the SELF-call on the very next line converted correctly. Fix:
  resolve the base record via `CrossRefGraph.get_base_signature()` and treat only
  `NPC_`/`CREA`/`ACHR`/`ACRE` as actors; unknown targets keep the behavior event,
  which is inert on an object but never corrupts an actor's graph. `PlayIdle`
  still uses the old `actor_func=True` assumption and needs the same treatment.
**Census the no-op lists against the real API, not against intuition.** Six
entries in `_NO_OP_FUNCS`/`_BARE_NO_EQUIV_COMMANDS` exist natively in Skyrim:
`AddAchievement` (59 call sites), `PlayBink` (5), `SendTrespassAlarm` (2),
`SetPublic` (1), `AttachAshPile`, and `GetCurrentPackage` (already special-cased
for the PACK-comparison form; the residual sites compare TES4 package-TYPE codes,
which genuinely have no equivalent). `SetCellPublicFlag` (100 sites) sets the same
Cell flag as `SetPublic` and should route there rather than no-op. The
authoritative list is the vanilla Papyrus sources at
`references/skse64-master/scripts/vanilla` — extract every `Function` declaration
and diff it against the no-op sets before assuming a command was dropped for a
good reason.

Losses that ARE correct and should not be re-litigated: `AddTopic` (223 `;NE:`)
is deliberate — `tes5_import/dialogue/unlocks.py` re-expresses topic visibility as
`TES4Unlock_*` GLOB gates and scans SCPT sources *because* script_convert leaves
an inert comment. `ModDisposition` (414) is a genuine engine removal, with the
`<= -100` hostility case already converting to `StartCombat`.

## GameMode steps are rates (2026-09-26, confirmed in game)
<a id="gamemode-steps-are-rates"></a>

**Code:** `script_convert/poll_motion.py`, `commands.py:set_pos`/`rotate`,
`TES4Polyfill.SpinAxis`/`GlideAxis`, `tes_runtime/tes/spin.cpp`.

TES4 ran GameMode every frame, so `set a to GetAngle Z` / `set b to a - 2` /
`SetAngle Z b` turns two degrees per FRAME. Nehrim's wheels, gears, platforms
and trains all move this way (171 sets in 105 scripts). A converted poll runs
every 0.1 s at best, and late whenever the VM is busy, so every motion paced by
it was wrong in game. Three versions failed:

1. **One glide per pass, one step each:** slow (about 20°/s where TES4 at 30 fps
   gave 60°/s) and choppy, because a late pass left the wheel standing still.
2. **The step scaled by the frames the pass stood for, with the glide kept
   between passes and aimed half a step ahead:** the wheel flickered. Each late
   or early pass re-aimed a wheel that was not where the chain expected it.
3. **The same glide sent to TESRuntime through a mod event:** still paced by
   Papyrus, so no better.

What works is MorrowindRuntime's model: a native tick at a steady 30 Hz re-aims
the object one tick ahead every tick. The converter finds each SetPos/SetAngle
whose value is the SAME object's axis read in the SAME pass, plus or minus a
step, and hands the step to `SpinAxis` as a rate per second: × 30 for a
per-frame step, ÷ `TES4_SecondsPassed` when the step itself holds
`GetSecondsPassed`. TESRuntime moves the object from then on, and stops an
axis no pass has renewed for 2.5 pass gaps (never under 0.5 s).

- **Same pass only.** A read inside an `if` counts only for statements after it
  in that branch. Nehrim's intro lift reads its base height once behind a
  DoOnce, and treating that base as a step gave the lift a nonsense rate.
- **Actors keep the Papyrus glide.** The cutscenes turn the player's view with
  per-frame SetAngle, and TranslateTo fights an actor's own movement.
- **The driver keeps its target within two ticks of the 3D,** so a paused game
  cannot bank a jump.
- **Without TESRuntime 5 or later,** `SpinAxis` falls back to `GlideAxis`.

**Absolute moves go to the same tick.** A SetPos that computes the position
itself (Nehrim's intro lift: a base height read once, plus elapsed time × speed)
has no step to call a rate. With TESRuntime 6 or later, `GlideAxis` sends each
target as a `TES4Track` event. TESRuntime moves the object from where it is
headed to the new target over 1.5 pass gaps, re-aimed every tick, so a late
pass never leaves it standing, and it lands exactly on the script's last target
when the script stops. A reference with no 3D is placed at once, as SetPosition
did.

**TES4 `Rotate <axis> <degrees per second>` is the same rate.** It was a
comment before, so every object it turned stood still (Nehrim 64 calls,
Morroblivion 29, Oblivion 9, including MQ09's bridge and the SEXedPuzStatue
puzzle). Inside a GameMode poll it is now `SpinAxis` at its authored rate; the
Papyrus fallback turns one pass's worth.

## The placed pose: `GetStartingPos` / `GetStartingAngle`
<a id="starting-pose"></a>

**Code:** `script_convert/start_pose.py`, `commands.py:starting_pose`,
`assemble.py:lifecycle`/`helpers`. **Tests:** `tests/test_starting_pose.py`.

TES4 answers both from the reference's record: the position and rotation it was
placed at, constant for its life. Scripts use them to bound a motion
(`if GetAngle z < GetStartingAngle z + 60`), to bob around a height, or to put
an object back where it belongs. Papyrus has no such read. The position read
converted to an inert `0` and the angle read to the LIVE angle, so a door that
opens "60 degrees from where it started" compared its angle with itself and
never stopped, and an object that snaps home went to the cell origin.
Oblivion.esm's `SEBruscusDannusItemSCRIPT` (49 placed clutter items, twelve
reads) is the shipped case: its `OnLoad` moved every item to 0, 0, 0.

A script that reads either on its OWN reference now takes its pose once:

- **Each read is a getter.** `GetStartingPos z` is `TES4_StartPosZ()`, which
  calls `TES4_CaptureStart()` and returns the stored value, so a read can sit in
  any event and still take the pose first. That matters after a save is loaded:
  `OnCellAttach` does not fire for the cell the save loads into and `OnLoad` is
  unreliable there (CK wiki), so a pending `OnUpdate` can be the first event the
  script gets.
- **The start events take it before they arm anything.** `OnCellAttach`,
  `OnLoad` (the converter's, or the script's own) and `OnInit` call the capture
  -- in `OnInit` ahead of the poll gate, which only passes in an attached cell.
  On a new game that is before the script's own statements run; another script
  or the physics can still move an object first. A script with no poll gets
  `OnCellAttach`, `OnLoad` and `OnInit` for this alone.
- **Only the axes read are stored,** as plain script variables saved with the
  instance, declared in sorted order (the reads are collected in a set, and the
  scripts convert in a process pool).
- **No parent cell, no pose.** The capture returns while `GetParentCell()` is
  `None`, which covers an item with no reference of its own. A script that
  tracks its holder (an object script with a poll) tests `TES4_Holder` first: a
  held item whose reference is still bound answers its old cell (see
  [carried items](#carried-items-and-read-books)), and the test also spares the
  logged error a native call on an unbound `Self` raises. A refused capture
  leaves the read at 0.0.
- **Every other subject is unchanged.** A read on another reference, in a
  quest, effect or topic script, or in a user function declines to the command
  rows: there is no pose of the script's own to take, and a live read standing
  in for the start is the defect this section removes. Only
  `assemble.build` declares the getters; a fragment is never converted as an
  object script.

🛑 **What it does not do.**

- **The pose is the one the object had when the script first saw it.** In a
  save made with an earlier conversion, an object that conversion already moved
  is taken where it stands, and stays wrong for that save. Measured in one: four
  swinging curtains 85 to 128 degrees off their placed angle, a statue 106
  units low. The export holds every placed pose; handing it to the script per
  reference is the follow-up that would repair those.
- **A cell reset takes the pose again.** It clears a reference script's
  variables and runs `OnInit` again (CK wiki: Cell Reset, OnReset, OnInit). That
  is right only if the engine has put the object back by then, which was not
  established.
- **Angles are not kept inside 0-360.** On a non-actor `GetAngleZ()` returns the
  stored value: a reference the poll had turned was saved at 471.00 degrees and
  the script's own read of it was 470.99997, across two reloads. A comparison of
  the live angle against start plus an offset therefore works on a continuous
  scale; a TES4 script that counts on a wrap at 360 does not get one.
- Not yet seen in game. The tests pin the emitted text; the eleven scripts that
  read a start pose in five exports convert and compile.

## Event / timer conversion
<a id="event-timer-conversion"></a>

- `begin OnAlarm` → `OnCombatStateChanged` guarded `aeCombatState != 0`;
  `OnStartCombat` bodies are guarded `== 1` (the event also fires on combat END).
- Bare `begin MenuMode` + `isPCSleeping` (Oblivion's sleep-detection idiom) →
  `RegisterForSleep()` + OnSleepStart/OnSleepStop running the body twice with a
  `TES4_PCSleeping` flag (11 quests incl. MG04 inn ambush, Rufio murder,
  vampirism relied on it). Menu-ID MenuMode blocks stay commented out.
- `GetSecondsPassed` substitutes `_get_update_interval()` (must equal the
  RegisterForSingleUpdate arg or timers run off-rate).
- Converted GameMode loops must not only start on cell attach — an
  already-loaded actor never ticks. They start from an `OnInit` gated on
  `TES4Polyfill.ShouldRunGameMode(Self)`.
- **That gate is cell attachment, NOT `Is3DLoaded()`** (2026-08-01). A disabled
  reference has no 3D, so a 3D-gated poll can never start on one — and the poll
  body is routinely the only thing that ever calls `Enable()` on that same
  reference. See "The self-enable deadlock" below.

### <a id="polled-conversations"></a>Say() timers — `TES4Polyfill.SayLine` (2026-08-16)

**The single design fact.** TES4's `Say`/`SayTo` were **synchronous**: the
engine picked the INFO, started the audio and **returned its length before the
next script line ran**, so every scripted conversation is written as

```
if CharacterGen.speaker == 4 && CharacterGen.convTimer <= 0
    set CharacterGen.convTimer to SayTo player, CharGenMain 1   ; := line length
endif
```

and every other participant waits on that one countdown. Papyrus `Say()` is
fire-and-forget and returns nothing. Every previous conversion tried to
*estimate* the missing number (a topic-max charge at the call site, a "park"
sentinel released by the End fragment, an OnBegin re-charge, per-owner
property bindings, a decay-proof beat companion, a race-safe decrement, an
`If T <= 0` override guard, three End-fragment ordering constraints, quest-
scoped release …) and each estimate had an edge where a line was cut, repeated,
dropped or held. **The rewrite stops estimating: the length comes from the
engine.**

#### The mechanism

* **Every INFO carries a Begin+End fragment pair** (`TES4_TIF__<fid>`, VMAD
  flags 0x03; `build_vmad_info_fragment` and `_info_batch` are both
  unconditional so the two sides can never disagree). Their fixed job:
  `Fragment_1` (OnBegin) → `TES4Polyfill.LineBegan(akSpeakerRef, <measured
  length of THIS line>)`; `Fragment_0` (OnEnd) → the TES4 result script, then
  `TES4Polyfill.LineEnded(akSpeakerRef)` **last**. The hooks carry only the
  speaker — no owner analysis, no property binding, nothing to miss.
* State lives in four script Actor Values **on the speaker** (`Variable07`
  claim, `Variable08` claim deadline, `Variable09` playing line's length,
  `Variable10` speaking deadline; deadlines in game time, see the polyfill).
* A converted `set T to [ref.]Say[To] … topic [+ n]` becomes
  ```
  T = <topic max + 1>                    ; closes this poll's own guard for the ~2s a SayLine can take
  T = TES4Polyfill.SayLine(<speaker>, <topic>, <topic max>) [+ n]
  ```
  `SayLine` **blocks until the engine has begun the line** and returns that
  line's real length **+ an adaptive tail**. The tail must cover the engine's
  own overhead between the measured audio length and the End fragment running
  (dispatch + trailing hold + inter-response gaps); it is stable per machine
  but unknowable in advance (measured here: median 0.35s, p90 0.54s; 11–24s
  under a starved VM), so `LineEnded` records each played-through line's
  overhead into a per-speaker running average (`Variable04`, plus a
  game-wide one on the player) and the tail is that estimate + 0.2s, clamped
  to [0.35, 2.5] (0.8 until anything is measured). A fixed 1.0s cost 0.6s of
  silence on every line (~1.5s audible gaps); a fixed 0.4 repeated lines when
  the VM was slow. Say-driving scripts poll at 0.25s and the pre-charge is
  capped at 2.0s (it is shared with the other speakers' guards, so a stray
  Say costs them at most that). Then the script continues at once, exactly
  as after TES4's `set T to Say`. A Say nothing qualifies for returns **0**
  after a 2s start timeout and the caller's own poll retries — Oblivion's
  behaviour too. Before Saying it waits while the speaker is in the player's
  dialogue menu (Oblivion froze GameMode in menus) or still speaking a tracked
  line (Skyrim silently drops a Say on a talking actor; Oblivion cut the line),
  and it keeps **one waiter per speaker** (a second SayLine returns 0.5 and the
  poll comes back). A `short` timer rounds UP (`Math.Ceiling`).
* **Fragments never write timers.** The owning script's countdown is a plain
  `T = T - dt` again; a fixed override right after the Say (`set convTimer to
  12`) replaces the length before any countdown, exactly as in Oblivion; a
  `set Q.convTimer to Q.convTimer + 2` in an End result lands on the live
  countdown's tail as an after-line pause; `convTimer - .4` "cut him off"
  trims it. None of that needs machinery any more.
* **An ACTOR script's poll skips the pass while the player is in a dialogue
  menu with anyone** — `Self.IsInDialogueWithPlayer() ||
  TES4Polyfill.PlayerIsInDialogue()` (Oblivion's GameMode never ran while a
  menu was open). Skyrim has no "is the player in dialogue" query, so
  `LineBegan` stamps the speaker of any line spoken inside the player's menu
  on the player (`Variable05/06` = FormID hi/lo) and `PlayerIsInDialogue`
  asks that actor. Two in-game failures drove it: the Emperor's
  `speaker == 4 && convTimer <= 0` poll fired during his stage-42 greeting
  (the greeting's End result is what sets `speaker = 0`), its SayLine waited
  for the menu and then spoke a stale "come closer" line exactly as stage
  44's force-greet arrived, which was consumed by a talking actor; and
  Baurus's stage-19 torch line fired INTO the player's conversation with the
  Emperor because a reply's result set stage 19 while the menu was open.
  Quest polls are NOT gated (the conversation countdown lives there; freezing
  it in 2026-08-14 shifted every beat).
* **Diagnostics are built in.** Every SayLine / LineBegan / LineEnded writes
  a `TES4Say …` `Debug.Trace` with real-time stamps; `python
  tools/dialog/say_trace_stats.py` turns the Papyrus log into Say→Begin latency,
  End overhead vs measured length (what SAY_TAIL must cover), pre-waits,
  drops and the dead-air gap between lines. Read those before touching the
  tail.
* Bare `Say`/`SayTo` (no assignment) stay plain fire-and-forget `Say()`
  (Nehrim's 727 hand-timed speech state machines). The measure-then-deliver
  pair (`set L to ref.Say T` / `ref.Say T`) collapses to the SayLine alone.
* The NPC-to-NPC driver (`tes5_import/dialogue/conversations.py`) uses the same
  primitive: `Utility.Wait(TES4Polyfill.SayLine(A, T, fallback) + 0.6)`.

#### Why results stay in the END fragment

Oblivion ran an INFO's result script when the line **finished**. The evidence
is the CS wiki's own scripted-conversation recipe (`How do you set up a
scripted conversation between two or more NPCs?`): it has each result write
`set <quest>.convTimer to <duration of sound file +/- a few seconds>` "to
further refine the timing between this dialogue and the next, and allowing for
momentary pauses" — an after-line pause, which is only meaningful if the
result runs at the end (at line start `set T to Say` would overwrite it). MQ04's
`set MQ04.convTimer to MQ04.convTimer + 2 / + 3 / + 10` beats and CharGen's
`convTimer - .4  ; cut him off` are the same idiom. So OnBegin only reports;
the sequence gate (`_sequence_gate`, applied only when the body itself steps
the counter it is conditioned on) still protects against a mid-line re-seed.

#### Measured in game (2026-08-16, CharacterGen 30-50, `TES4Say` traces)

* Say→Begin latency **0.14–0.26s** when the engine takes the line.
* End overhead (End fragment vs measured audio) **0.4–0.72s** for single
  lines — so a 0.4 tail was genuinely too small and 1.0 leaves ~0.3s.
* **The player can skip a menu line** (click through) and **exit the menu**
  mid-line; Skyrim then runs the skipped line's End and the next line's
  Begin in the SAME frame, End sometimes second. An unconditional clear in
  `LineEnded` wiped the flag of the line that had just started; the speaker's
  own poll saw him idle, and its `Say()` **INTERRUPTED the live line — a Say
  on a talking actor is not always dropped, it can cut the line, and the cut
  line's End result is lost** (`CGEmperor09`'s `setstage 43` → birthsign
  menu never opened). Hence the length-matched clear.
* A Goodbye reply keeps playing after the menu closes; `IsInDialogueWithPlayer`
  goes false at once. Hence `PlayerIsInDialogue()` also holds while the last
  dialogue speaker is still speaking, and QUEST polls are gated too (stage
  `45 → 50` fired from the quest poll mid-dialogue and sent Baurus in).
* **The Papyrus VM starves easily** (`Update budget: 1.2ms` per frame in the
  log). With the dialogue gate on every poll (~210 quest polls at 0.1s +
  every actor poll), from the START of CharacterGen the End fragments of 1–2s
  lines ran **11–17s late**, the VM dumped stacks, SayLine's 10s busy margin
  expired first and "Yessir" played twice. Only scripts that speak carry the
  gate now (153 in Oblivion), the busy deadline is length+30s (it only bounds
  a lost End), the pre-charge is capped at 3.5s (it is shared with the other
  participants' guards), and the start timeout is 1.5s nominal (each
  iteration is a VM turn, so it stretches with load). Same code from a stage-30
  save had 0.4–0.7s End overhead — load, not logic, was the difference.
* Right after an ambush, `Say(CharGenMain)` on Glenroy was refused for ~20s
  while his HELLO greeting bark did play (combat/search state — traces now log
  `inCombat`/`weaponDrawn`); the first Say after a busy wait was dropped
  because the End fragment was still returning — hence the 0.25s wait.

#### What was measured (Oblivion.esm)

397 timer-assigned Say sites in 207 scripts over 275 topics (+28 in QUST stage
results, 1 in an INFO result); 409 bare Say sites; Nehrim: 0 timer-assigned,
727 bare. Only 6 INFO results write a Say timer (MQ04's three beats, the
CharGen `- .4`, one `= 1`, one unrelated `timer = 0`).

#### Traps

* `Utility.GetCurrentRealTime()` restarts with the process, so a deadline
  stamped in one session is garbage in the next — deadlines are game-time
  days at the current TimeScale (`_GameDays`).
* A dead SayLine thread (mod update, script removed) would hold the per-speaker
  claim; the claim is renewed every 0.1s and expires 5s after the last
  renewal, so it can never strand a speaker.
* A lost End (actor killed or unloaded mid-line) expires the speaking state
  `length + tail + 2s` after Begin — a stale busy flag costs one line's length,
  never a stall.
* If OnBegin ever fired *before* the audio started by more than SAY_TAIL, the
  guard would reopen while the audio still played and the same speaker's next
  SayLine would wait on the busy flag (bounded) before Saying — no repeat is
  possible because the state has advanced by then, but the pause would show.
  Raise `SAY_TAIL` in `TES4Polyfill.psc` if that is ever observed.

#### <a id="sequenced-fragment-surgery"></a>Sequenced fragment surgery — `conversation_sequence.py`

**Code:** `script_convert/conversation_sequence.py`, consumed only by
`pipeline._info_batch`.

A polled conversation is a **sequencer**: each INFO is gated on an exact
counter (`GetQuestVariable CharacterGen.convCount == 8`) and its result script
steps that counter to hand the turn to the next line. Because TES4's `Say` was
synchronous the whole body ran in the frame the line STARTED; running the same
body at OnEnd breaks it four different ways, each fixed by one helper.

- <a id="sequence-gate"></a>**`sequence_gate` — the counter is re-seeded
  out-of-band.** Quest stages re-seed it ("make sure we're at the right spot",
  10 of them in CharacterGen alone) and those stages fire off *package
  completion*, which lands whenever the actor arrives, not when the line ends.
  A re-seed landing mid-line makes the in-flight line's `+1` overshoot:
  CharacterGen stage 12 sets `convCount=8` for "What's this prisoner doing
  here?" while line 7 is still audible, line 7's fragment makes it 9, and the
  cell-door exchange never plays (runtime trace: `FRAG 00032B0A cnt=8` →
  `cnt=9 spk=0`). Gating the fragment on the counter the INFO itself requires
  makes the re-seed authoritative. Applied **only** when the body actually
  steps that counter — a line the quest script advances for is not a sequencer
  and must never be gated.

- <a id="turn-handoff"></a>**`split_turn_handoff` — the handoff cannot wait for
  OnEnd.** In TES4 the result script set `convCount`/`speaker` and charged
  `convTimer` in the frame the line started, so the next speaker's guard
  (`speaker == N && convTimer <= 0`) was already open and only the timer paced
  him. Emitting the handoff at OnEnd makes every line pay a serial round trip
  (measured, `temp/chargen_rec_5.log`):

  ```

  Only the counter step and `speaker`/`target` literal writes move to OnBegin.
  Stage advances, AddTopic unlocks and item/faction changes stay in OnEnd:
  those are consequences of the line having been DELIVERED, not of whose turn
  it is.

- <a id="stepped-gate"></a>**`stepped_gate` — OnEnd must test the STEPPED
  value.** Once OnBegin performs the handoff the counter has already moved, so
  the original `convCount == 8` is false by OnEnd and the rest of the body —
  item grants, faction changes, the author's other writes — would be silently
  dropped. The compared value is shifted by the same delta the step applies.

- <a id="stage-advances-survive"></a>**`split_stage_advances` — a stage advance
  must survive a REJECTED turn.** The gate originally swallowed the fragment's
  `SetStage` too, and that line is frequently the only path to the next quest
  beat: a package-completion re-seed landed while CharacterGen line 11 was
  still audible, line 11's End fragment was rejected, its `SetStage(13)` never
  ran, and the quest stalled forever — the Emperor greeted generically and
  offered only 'Rumors', with nothing in the Papyrus log because a rejected
  gate is silent by design. Advances are lifted OUTSIDE the gate behind a
  monotonic guard, which is safe because TES4 stages are flags and `GetStage`
  returns the highest set: past N already → skipped; turn rejected but the
  advance still owed → it runs. Only TOP-LEVEL
  `<quest>.SetStage(<literal>)` lines are lifted.

- <a id="writes-before-setstage"></a>**`state_writes_before_setstage` —
  `SetStage` runs its fragment INLINE.** Those fragments call
  `EvaluatePackage()`, and the engine arbitrates packages against whatever
  state is committed at that instant, so a `speaker`/`convCount` write placed
  after the SetStage is invisible to it. CharacterGen stage 18 showed it
  directly: the package was selected then kicked back within the same second
  (`PKGSTART 04D84D` → `PKGCHANGE` back to `032B14`), and whether it stuck
  varied run to run purely on engine latency. Only literal assignments are
  hoisted, and only from a FLAT tail — a nested block after the SetStage may
  depend on what the stage did, and `classify` is the shared barrier (it also
  stops on a `Return`, which this pass's own regex did not; measured: no
  fragment body has one in the tail, 0 of 75,170). Hoisting a write above the
  SetStage can strand it below a `Start()` on the same quest, the one
  reordering that silently destroys it — Skyrim's `Start()` resets every Auto
  property, losing the seeded value (`ArenaICGrandChampion`'s `CrazyIdea`, 2
  sites) — so `hoist_quest_start_above_writes` re-establishes that invariant on
  the reordered result. That is a fixup of this pass's own output, not a second
  pass over the script.

The two narrow regexes exist for the same reason. `_STATE_WRITE_RE` matches a
bare literal assignment or a counter step on ITSELF — no calls, nothing whose
value depends on anything a `SetStage` could change, because 13 CharacterGen
stage fragments re-seed `convCount`. `_HANDOFF_WRITE_RE` matches a bare literal
assignment to a field whose name says it selects the next talker.

## Magic / condition helpers
<a id="magic-condition-helpers"></a>

- `pme`/`sme` (PlayMagicEffectVisuals) take a MGEF code, not a shader: resolve
  code → TES4 MGEF → its `DATA.EffectShader` (else EnchantEffect, else school
  enchant glow) → converted EFSH, and emit `<shader>.Play(ref, dur)`. EFSH
  records are converted, so the property binds.
- `HasMagicEffect X` on an MGEF → `ref.HasMagicEffectWithKeyword(TES4FX_x)`,
  and `IsSpellTarget S` → the same test on S's first effect with an MGEF
  record: the converted spell carries a copy of the effect, and only the
  family keyword is shared
  ([effect families](tes5_import_magic.md#effect-families)).

## Reaching 100% compile (2026-07-28, 42 → 0 failures)
<a id="reaching-100-compile"></a>

Nehrim 2620/2620 and Oblivion 15959/15959 now compile. The failures clustered
into a few generic causes, all fixed in the converter rather than per-script:

- **Comma-form RECEIVER on a zero-arg command.** `StopCombat, Player` /
  `IsInCombat, Player == 1` name the *receiver*, not an argument — the comma
  spelling of `Player.StopCombat`. Treating it as an argument gave `IsInCombat(Player)`
  ("function takes 0 parameters not 1") or dropped the token and acted on the
  WRONG ACTOR. `_ZERO_ARG_REF_FUNCTIONS` (derived from the empty-argument `ref.`
  rows of `docs/reference/skyrim_commands.md`) drives the promotion. **When widening the
  bool-comparison regex, keep the `\b` and the mandatory separator** — without
  them `GetDead` matched the prefix of `GetDeadCount` and split off `Count` as an
  argument across 28 scripts.
- **A local variable may shadow `player`.** `StartCelleAufzugTriggerZone01Script`
  declares `Short Player` as its own trigger flag; substituting the keyword gave
  the un-assignable `Game.GetPlayer() = 1`. Locals win in a VALUE position but
  never as a **receiver** (a Short has no methods) and never inside
  `IsActionRef`, whose operand is always a reference — hence
  `_convert_ref(..., as_receiver=True)`.
- **Property names must key on the CANONICAL EditorID.** TES4 lookup is
  case-insensitive, so `SetEssential Kornderbraumeister` refers to
  `KornderBraumeister`; keying on the local spelling created a second
  `_property_refs` entry differing only in case, and since Papyrus is also
  case-insensitive the two declarations collided and the typed one lost.
  Where the EditorID collides with one of the script's own variables (MQ19Script
  has an `Int narel` beside the NPC_ `Narel`), `_actor_base_property()` mints a
  `<Name>Base` property and `resolve_property_formid` strips the suffix to bind it.
- **A mapped GLOBAL call takes no receiver.** `Player.DisablePlayerControls`
  emitted `Game.GetPlayer().Game.DisablePlayerControls()`. Any `FUNCTION_MAP`
  target starting `Game.`/`Utility.`/`Debug.`/`Math.` drops the TES4 receiver.
- **`as` binds tighter than arithmetic.** A trailing `as Int` only types the whole
  expression when no bare operator precedes it; `A - B.GetValue() as Int` is
  `Float - Int`. Also: a plain Float→Int copy (`ihour = vtime`) needs the cast
  just as much as an expression does, and OBSE `let` needs the same coercion
  `set` already had.
- **No-equivalent handlers must return a BARE literal.** These sit inside larger
  conditions, where a trailing `;` comment swallows the rest of the line
  (`If True  ;(False ;NE: ...)`). Push the note to `_line_comments` instead.
- **Match no-equivalent FAMILIES by pattern, not by name.** Enumerating OBSE
  commands one per build is how `disableKey` and `setMenuFloatValue` each survived
  to fail alone. `con_*`, `get/setMenu*`, and the input family are prefix-matched,
  and the bare-read router honours those prefixes without a `FUNCTION_MAP` entry.

New native equivalents found (always check before declaring one absent):

| TES4 / OBSE | Papyrus | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `GetDeadCount <base>` | `ActorBase.GetDeadCount()` | Exact match. Previously emitted a literal `0`, silently disabling **152 quest gates** (126 of them `== 1` checks that became `0 == 1`). |
| `SetEssential` | `ActorBase.SetEssential(bool)` | On ActorBase, not Actor. |
| `PositionWorld x y z ang ws` | `SetPosition` + `SetAngle` | No worldspace param; dropped. |
| `ForceFlee` / `Flee` | `SetActorValue("Confidence", 0)` + `EvaluatePackage()` | Skyrim drives fleeing off Confidence — the engine's own mechanism. |
| `GetAttacked` | `Actor.IsAlarmed() as Int` | |
| `IsInAir` | `Actor.IsFlying() as Int` | |
| `con_Save` | dropped | See [console saves are dropped](#console-saves-are-dropped). |
| `DispelSpell` | `Actor.DispelSpell(Spell)` | Actor-only — must NOT sit in `_OBJREF_SHARED_FUNCTIONS`. |
| `$var` (OBSE) | `(var as String)` | `$` is not even a legal Papyrus character. |
| `string_var` / `array_var` | `String` | Missing from `TYPE_MAP`, so the variable got **no declaration at all**. |

Genuinely absent (inert `;NE:`): OBSE UI/menu (`get/setMenu*`), raw input
(`isKeyPressed*`, `disableKey`, `getControl`), console commands (`con_*`),
INI access (`Set/GetNumericINISetting`), `getCrosshairRef`, `getObjectType`
(Skyrim's form-type numbering differs entirely), `GetStringGameSetting` (Papyrus
has only the numeric getters), `SkipAnim`, `getPackageTarget`, and
`UnlockAchievement`. An OBSE `forEach … loop` suppresses its **whole body** — the
body reads an iterator that cannot exist.

A cross-script write to a variable the owner never declares
(`AutoSaveQuest.ReadyForAutosave`, 3 scripts) is **dangling in the original mod**.
Oblivion ignored it; Papyrus fails the whole file, so it is commented out.

## Syntax traps found via Nehrim (2026-07-20, 50.5% → 98.4% compile rate)
<a id="syntax-traps"></a>

- **`;/` opens a Papyrus BLOCK comment** (closed by `/;`). Oblivion scripts use
  `;//////...` banner rules constantly and TES4 had no block-comment syntax, so
  every banner swallowed the rest of the file. The compiler only reports this as
  `unexpected end of file` at the LAST line, and one unterminated banner in a
  widely-extended base script cascaded into ~300 downstream failures.
  `_postprocess_lines` pads a space after the `;`.
- **Oblivion accepted a comma between a command and its first argument**
  (`IsActionRef, Player`, `MessageBox, "text"`, `SetPCExpelled Fac, 1`).
  `_emit_function` strips a leading comma once for all handlers; the expression
  router also matches `^(\w+)(?:\s*,\s*|\s+)(.+)$`. Handlers that
  `split(None, 1)` must still `rstrip(',')` the token.
- **TES4 EditorIDs may start with a digit** (`1Feuerball`, `01SetBonus...`);
  Papyrus identifiers may not. Regexes anchored on `^[a-zA-Z_]` silently skipped
  these, leaving the raw name in the output. Use `^\w+` and exclude pure digits /
  `(?!\d+\.)` so float literals still parse. `_safe_property_name` strips the
  leading digit for the declaration, so call sites must go through the same
  lookup or the two disagree.
- **`"EditorID".Function` (quoted ref)** is valid TES4 and appears in 143 Nehrim
  scripts. Unquote before the ref patterns run, or the call is emitted as a
  property access on a string.
- **Anything unparseable must be emitted COMMENTED**, never as bare code — TES4
  uses `-----` separator rules, which parse as a prefix expression.
- A `FUNCTION_MAP` entry with a `None` Papyrus name normally falls through to the
  EditorID lookup on purpose (bare `getSecondsPassed` etc. are rewritten by later
  passes; routing them early TODO's them mid-expression and leaves
  `timer = timer - `). Bare-read commands that have no such pass belong in
  `_BARE_NO_EQUIV_COMMANDS`.
- `Activate` conversions: bare `Activate` → `(akActionRef/self, true)`. Passing
  `Game.GetPlayer()` produced door/lockpick/teleport storms.

### The last activator outside OnActivate
<a id="last-activator"></a>

A bare `Activate` (or `GetActionRef`) in a GameMode block means the object's
LAST activator: Nehrim's mining rocks and dig sites (`WerkzeugSteinSchuerfenScript`,
`WerkzeugSchatzErdhaufenScript`) play the swing in OnActivate, then a second
later `Activate` opens the container for the player. OnUpdate has no action-ref
parameter, so this emitted `Activate(None, true)` — a container opened by
nobody. A script with an OnActivate block now records `TES4_LastActivator =
akActionRef` first thing in OnActivate, and every event without an action-ref
parameter reads that variable. Scripts without OnActivate keep `None`/`Self`.

## OBSE constructs (Nehrim depends on these heavily)
<a id="obse-constructs"></a>

- **User-defined functions**: `begin Function{ a, b }` + `Call <ScriptName> arg1,
  arg2` (first arg space-separated, rest comma-separated; param list may use
  EITHER separator). Converted to a Papyrus method named `TES4Call` on the callee
  script, reached through a property typed as that script. NOT `Global` — the
  bodies read the script's own object properties.
  - Params must NOT also be emitted as auto-properties; the parameter would
    shadow the property while callers write neither, so the body reads a
    permanent 0.
  - A TES4 `ref` param is an untyped handle: type it from USAGE (convert the body
    first, then read `_property_refs`), else `Form`. Typing it
    `ObjectReference` — the literal translation — rejected all 170 call sites
    that pass a Spell.
  - `SetFunctionValue X` sets the result and does NOT end the function; see
    [below](#set-function-value).

### SetFunctionValue keeps running
<a id="set-function-value"></a>

OBSE's `SetFunctionValue X` stores the result; the function continues to its
`return` or its end. The converter assumed a `return` always followed and
dropped the value otherwise — `HMSfromFloat24h` ends `SetFunctionValue sTime`,
`sv_destruct sTime`, `end`, so Nehrim's wait menu got no time string. It also
typed every result `Int`. Now `SetFunctionValue X` → `TES4_Result = X`, every
`return` → `Return TES4_Result`, a trailing `Return TES4_Result` closes the
function, and the first value's type is the return type (`String` here).

### A function script is hosted on its own quest
<a id="udf-host-quest"></a>

Converting the function was only half of it: the callee property must be FILLED
with a record carrying the script. The fill resolves the script's EditorID to
the SCPT's own FormID, and no Skyrim record lived there, so every property read
`None` — Nehrim's 474 calls (244 of them `GlobalScriptExpGained`, the XP
awards) all logged `Cannot call TES4Call() on a None object`, while every
script still compiled. The July OBSE audit had marked `Call` "handled" from
compilation alone.

- A script with a `begin Function` block is HOSTED as a quest script
  (`cross_ref.hosted_script_type`), so it `extends Quest`. The detector must
  match both SCTX spellings: the CLI scan sees export-escaped `\n`, the
  importer's parsed records carry real CRLF — matching only the first made the
  scripts `extends Quest` while no host quest was written.
- Two of the 25 Morroblivion functions DO use `Self` (`fbmwMoveToFunct` calls a
  bare `MoveTo`, `JDLevitate` plays a sound on it), which the next section covers.
- The importer writes one never-started QUST per function script at the SCPT's
  own FormID (`object_scripts.write_udf_host_quests`), so the fills callers
  already carry resolve. No FormID moves: source SCPT ids are reserved against
  derived ids and nothing else occupied them.
- A never-started quest still works: the CK wiki's OnInit page says quest
  scripts initialise at game startup, before and independent of the quest
  starting.
- Script variables are properties, and that is RIGHT: xOBSE
  (`FunctionScripts.cpp`, `FunctionContext`) reuses the function's one
  persistent event list unless the call is recursive, so values carry over
  between calls.
- `vmad_property_typecheck.py --cross-master` checks script-typed properties for
  existence; it reports this defect as `<no such record>`.

### A user function's `Self` is its calling reference
<a id="udf-calling-reference"></a>

OBSE runs `Player.Call fbmwMoveToFunct marker` with Player as the function's
implicit reference, and a bare `Call` with the caller's own. Hosted on a quest,
the function has no reference of its own, so `TES4Call` takes the calling
reference as its FIRST parameter (`akCallingRef`) and the body's `Self` is
rewritten to it. Every call site passes one — the receiver, the caller's own
reference, or `None` from a quest script. It is uniform because a caller is
converted without seeing the callee's body. Two Morroblivion functions used
`Self` and failed to compile until this.

### A nested command no longer erases its caller's arguments
<a id="nested-call-arguments"></a>

The current call's argument nodes live in one converter field,
`_arg_nodes`. Converting an argument that itself holds a command replaced that
field with the INNER call's arguments, so every later argument of the outer
call read as absent: `Call GlobalScriptExpGained 30 * (getPCMiscStat 8 - l), 1,
1, -1` emitted `TES4Call(30 * (...), , , )`. `dispatch.emit_command` now
restores the caller's arguments when a command finishes.

### `forEach` is a block
<a id="foreach-is-a-block"></a>

`forEach <it> <- <container> ... loop` parses as a `ForEach` node owning its body,
and the emitter comments out exactly that block. Papyrus has no OBSE container
iterator, so the body cannot run. Before, the parser read the `loop` as an
unmatched closer, the emitter's "inside a forEach" counter never came down, and
EVERY statement after the first forEach in the event was commented out —
Nehrim's `AAGeneralUpdateQuest` lost its lock-picking and discovery XP awards,
its music check and more.

### GetPCMiscStat names the stat
<a id="pc-misc-stat-names"></a>

TES4 numbers its misc stats (xEdit `wbMiscStatEnum`, 34 entries); Skyrim's
`Game.QueryStat` / `IncrementStat` take the stat's NAME (CK wiki
`ListOfTrackedStats`). The old row passed the number as the name —
`QueryStat("8")` — which the game rejects (`Misc stat "3" is not a stat` in the
Papyrus log) and reads as 0. `TES4_MISC_STAT_NAMES` maps each index to the
Skyrim stat with the same meaning (Places Discovered → Locations Discovered,
Potions Made → Potions Mixed, People Fed On → Necks Bitten, Days In Prison →
Days Jailed, Hours Waited → Hours Waiting). Picks Broken, Oblivion Gates Shut,
Artifacts Found, Last Day As Vampire and Jokes Told have no Skyrim stat and
read as 0 with a note.
- `eval <expr>` is a pure pass-through wrapper (Nehrim uses it only around
  `Call`) — drop it. Beware over-broad stripping: an earlier pass ate a variable
  named `Eval`.
- `Let X := Y` and the compound forms `+= -= *= /=` → `X = X op Y` (Papyrus has
  no compound assignment).
- **OBSE `IsCasting` maps NATIVELY** — `GetAnimationVariableBool("bIsCastingRight"
  /"bIsCastingLeft")`, no SKSE needed. Check for a native equivalent before
  declaring a function unconvertible.
- **`sv_Construct` is the ONE OBSE string command with an exact equivalent**: it
  builds a `string_var` from a literal, and a Papyrus `String` *is* that literal,
  so `set q to sv_Construct "text"` → `q = "text"`. It used to fall through to
  the inert `ar_`/`sv_` catch-all below, which left an undefined identifier and
  failed the whole script (2026-08-02). `sv_Destruct` stays a no-op — Papyrus
  strings are garbage-collected, so there is nothing to free.
- No Papyrus equivalent, emitted inert with `;NE:` — OBSE arrays/strings (`ar_*`,
  the rest of `sv_*`, `forEach`), path-based music (`StreamMusic` and Nehrim's bundled `emc*`
  plugin; Skyrim music is MusicType-based), `GetPlayerHasLastRiddenHorse`,
  `HasFlames`/`AddFlames`/`RemoveFlames`, `PositionCell` (Papyrus `MoveTo` takes
  a reference, not cell coordinates).
- `Set/GetIgnoreFriendlyHits` map to `IgnoreFriendlyHits(bool)` /
  `IsIgnoringFriendlyHits()`. Dropping the setter made scripted allies (Nehrim's
  Celebro in the intro) turn on the player at the first stray hit.

## Scripts on placed references
<a id="scripts-placed-references"></a>

Reference events (`OnPackageEnd`, `OnActivate`) never fire on a base NPC_ VMAD —
they must be relocated to the placed ACHR. This was the CharacterGen stage-10
stall.

### Bare self-reference calls also force relocation (2026-08-01)

`_relocate_actor_scripts_to_refs` originally moved a script for two reasons: a
`GetVMScriptVariable` package gate, or a `begin <reference-event>` declaration.
There is a **third**: a script that calls a reference function on *itself* with
no `ref.` prefix — `enable`, `disable`, `moveto`, `startcombat`, `playgroup`,
`evp`, … An ActorBase is not a reference, so on the base record these calls have
nothing to act on and do nothing at all, whatever event drives them.

This matters because Oblivion's standard scripted-entrance idiom is an
**initially-disabled placement (record flag 0x800) whose OWN GameMode block
enables it on a cue**. `_script_uses_self_reference_call` now detects the bare
call (skipping comment lines, so a commented-out `;evp` does not trigger a move,
and requiring no `.` prefix so `CelebroRef.Disable` — someone *else's* method,
which works fine from the base — does not either).

### The self-enable deadlock (2026-08-01)

The same idiom hit a second, independent bug in the poll gate. The chain:

1. The ref is initially disabled → **no 3D**.
2. `OnLoad` / `OnCellAttach` need 3D or a cell *transition*; a ref already
   sitting in the player's starting cell gets neither.
3. The `OnInit` fallback was gated on `Is3DLoaded()` → **false while disabled**.
4. So the poll never starts, `Enable()` never runs, the ref never gets 3D.

The script that enables the reference only runs once the reference is enabled —
unbreakable. **200 placed refs in Nehrim** were stranded this way (Kim/MQ04,
Erik/NQ01, the MQ20 paladins, MQ31 batteries, MQ33 mirages, sound zones).

The fix is `TES4Polyfill.ShouldRunGameMode(akRef)`: 3D-loaded **or** parent cell
attached. Oblivion's own rule was cell-scoped, not 3D-scoped — GameMode ran for
every ref in an active cell, disabled ones included, which is precisely what
makes the self-enable idiom work. Cell attachment preserves the anti-storm
property the 3D gate was introduced for (refs in detached cells still never
tick); it only stops treating "invisible" as "not there".

**Nehrim intro symptom:** Celebro, the companion who is supposed to attack a
troll and then talk to the player, never appeared in the start cell
(`StartCelle`, 0x00000B9B). `MQ00CelebroScript` is nothing but
`begin GameMode / if ( GetStage MQ00 == 5 ) / enable / endif` — it declared no
reference event, so it stayed on the base NPC_ (bug 1), and its poll was
3D-gated, so it could not have run anyway (bug 2). Both had to be fixed for him
to spawn.

### <a id="poll-lifecycle"></a>What starts and stops a reference's poll

`assemble.lifecycle` arms an object or actor poll from three events:

- **OnCellAttach** fires each time the reference streams into an active cell,
  which confines the loop to when the object is present, like TES4 GameMode.
- **OnLoad** covers a reference already standing in an attached cell when the
  script binds (new game, or the player is already there). OnCellAttach only
  fires when a cell *becomes* attached, so without OnLoad the poll never
  started. That kept Arielle (MG04Restore) standing still: her package waits on
  `startconv == 1`, which only her GameMode body sets.
- **OnInit**, behind the poll gate. OnInit alone is not enough on a placed
  reference because it runs before the 3D exists (that silenced Valen Dreth).
  The gate keeps the anti-storm property: an unconditional OnInit register made
  every scripted object in the game start ticking at load.

**Nothing unregisters on OnCellDetach.** Cell-transition events arrive in no
guaranteed order, so the detach for the old cell could land after
OnLoad/OnCellAttach had re-armed the poll for the new one and kill a loaded
actor's loop mid-scene (the CharacterGen escort NPCs went mute this way). The
gate in OnUpdate stops the loop itself one tick after the reference leaves.

### <a id="carried-items-and-read-books"></a>Carried items and books read from an inventory (2026-09-26, confirmed in game)

**Code:** `assemble._track_holder`, `assemble._carried_read`, `cross_ref.attached_signatures`.

TES4 runs an item's GameMode block while it sits in a container, and a book's
`OnActivate` is its "the player read this" hook. Skyrim breaks both:

- **The poll died on pickup.** The gate refused any reference without a parent
  cell, so a GameMode body that finishes after pickup never ran. Nehrim's torn
  note (`SchattenrufNotizScript`) sets MQ00 stage 27 (the torch journal entry)
  from GameMode once its MenuMode block has marked it read. Now
  `OnContainerChanged` and `OnEquipped` record the holder in `TES4_Holder` and
  re-arm, and the gate also passes while the holder is loaded.
- **`OnActivate` misses carried reads.** A read from the inventory, or a take
  by a perk-based "take books" mod, never raises it. For scripts attached only
  to BOOK records whose `OnActivate` contains a bare `Activate` (51 in Nehrim,
  23 in Oblivion), the same body also runs from `OnRead` with the opening
  `Activate` dropped. `OnActivate` sets `TES4_ReadByActivate`, so the read its
  own book-open raises is skipped and the body runs once per read.
- **Nothing ticked after the read.** An in-game trace showed `OnEquipped` and
  `OnRead` arrive during the book menu and `OnRead` set `lesen = 1`, but the
  note's poll never ticked again. `OnRead` now calls `Utility.Wait(0.001)`
  (the CK wiki's idiom for waiting out an open menu) and runs one `OnUpdate()`
  pass, as TES4 GameMode ran on the first frame after the menu.

Measured along the way (save `save_papyrus_dump`, Papyrus log, one trace):

- `GetParentCell()` is **not** a carried-item test. The first `OnRead` guard
  `If !GetParentCell()` skipped the body silently for a taken note.
- A mod's perk take bypasses `OnActivate` entirely. The note's `lesen` stayed 0.
- Books whose `OnActivate` never opens them (Oghma Infinium, Nehrim's
  Jagdbuch books) keep `OnActivate` only; their activation replaces reading.

Known gap: when a player activation of a book is consumed without opening it
(a "not yet readable" gate), the flag stays set and the next carried read is
skipped once.

### A bare GameMode block also forces relocation (2026-08-02)

The two triggers above still missed a whole class: an actor script that is
**nothing but a `GameMode` block making explicit `Other.Method()` calls**. It
declares no reference event and makes no bare self-call, so neither reason
fired and it rode the base NPC_ — where it is dead code, because the converter
compiles `GameMode` into an OnUpdate poll whose only starters are
`OnCellAttach` / `OnCellDetach` / `OnLoad` / `OnInit`, all gated on
`TES4Polyfill.ShouldRunGameMode(Self)`. Every one of those is an
`ObjectReference` member; on a base VMAD `Self` is an `ActorBase`, so the events
never fire, the gate has no reference to answer for, and the poll never starts.

`gamemode` is therefore in `_TES4_REFERENCE_EVENTS` now. It is not an engine
reference event — it is there because *our own* lowering of it is
reference-only.

**Morroblivion symptom:** `CATDestinationSorter`, the script driving the
Cyrodiil↔Vvardenfell world transport, is pure GameMode polling a global
(`CATDestinationCode`) and calling `Player.MoveTo(marker)`. Attached to the
base NPC_ of both ferrymen (Kisimba in the Imperial City, Jo'Tesh in Seyda
Neen), it never ran: the player paid 1000 gold, the dialogue fragment set the
destination code, and nothing ever moved them.

### A script on the PLAYER base needs a quest alias (2026-08-01)
<a id="player-base-script-needs-quest-alias"></a>

**A type-0 script's base must be one EVERY attaching record can bind.** Papyrus
refuses a script whose declared base does not match the form ("Unable to bind
script X because their base types do not match"), so a script shared between an
actor and a non-actor record cannot be `Actor` — the non-actor copies would
silently never attach. Scanning for the FIRST actor attachment and returning
early did exactly that to `NoActivationScript`, which Oblivion puts on **both a
DOOR and an NPC_**. `Actor extends ObjectReference`, so the shared base binds to
both and every inherited event still resolves.

The player-base case is the exception, and only when the player base is the
script's SOLE attachment — a script shared with real NPCs still has to bind to
them as an `Actor`.

Oblivion let a plugin script the player by attaching a SCPT to the player's base
`NPC_ 0x00000007`. **Skyrim has no equivalent binding**, and the relocation above
cannot help: it walks ACHR/ACRE, and the player has no ACHR — `PlayerRef 0x14` is
engine-created and its record signature is **PLYR**, not ACHR, so a plugin cannot
author an override of it. PlayerRef's base is *Skyrim's own* `0x07`; our shifted
copy (`0x01000007`) is a record nothing ever instantiates, so a VMAD there is
inert.

Vanilla's mechanism for "code that runs on the player forever" is a
start-game-enabled quest holding a reference alias forced to `0x14`, with the
script on that **alias** — `JailQuestPlayerScript`, `TutorialPlayerScript`; 71
Skyrim.esm quests force an alias to `0x14`, and the vanilla `Player` NPC_ carries
no VMAD at all. The converter now mints `TES4PlayerScripts` for this
(`object_scripts.build_player_alias_plan` →
`dialog_converter._make_player_script_quest`), lists it in the `.seq`, and emits
the script as `extends ReferenceAlias`, routing every implicit-self call through
`GetReference()` / `GetActorReference()` (`Self` there is the alias, so
`Self as Actor` is a cast the compiler rejects).

Vanilla Oblivion attaches nothing to the player base, so this only ever surfaced
on Nehrim — where `GlobalplayerScript` holds the **entire** XP / level /
learning-point / gold economy *and* the only `SetStage MQ00 1`, which is what
starts the main quest. Without it the intro never began and no character levelled.

Two consequences worth remembering:

- **The player is never a script-typed property.** `player`/`playerref` is a
  converter keyword emitted as `Game.GetPlayer()`. Because the player base has
  EditorID `Player` *and* can carry a SCRI, both `_add_scro_ref` (which skipped
  only `0x14`, not `0x07`) and `get_record_script_type` typed it as the attached
  script — so 242 Nehrim scripts declared
  `TES4_GlobalplayerScript Property Player` and then failed to convert it to
  `ObjectReference` at every `X.GetDistance(Player)` / `MoveTo(Player)`.
- **A property typed as the attached script is not an Actor.** `_add_scro_ref`
  deliberately prefers the script type so cross-script variable reads work, so
  actor-only calls on such a property must be **cast at the call site**
  (`(KreoRef as Actor).EvaluatePackage()`) rather than retyped — and likewise for
  arguments of the four functions whose Papyrus signature declares an `Actor`
  (`_ACTOR_ARG_FUNCTIONS`: `StartCombat`, `IsHostileToActor`,
  `GetRelationshipRank`, `SetRelationshipRank`).

### Quoted EditorIDs — the `_MQ01Tate_` property (2026-08-01)

Oblivion's parser accepts quotes around any EditorID and Nehrim's authors use
them constantly (**173 sites**: `SetStage "MQ01Tate" 20`, `GetStage "NQ00Karick"`,
`StartQuest "NQ05"`, `AddScriptPackage "..."`). `_safe_property_name` maps
`[^\w]` to `_`, so `"MQ01Tate"` became the property `_MQ01Tate_` while the *same
script's* unquoted `GetStage MQ01Tate` became `MQ01Tate`. Only the unquoted
spelling matches an EditorID, so only it was bound in the VMAD — `_MQ01Tate_`
stayed **None** and every `_MQ01Tate_.SetStage(...)` threw at runtime.

The damage was structural, not cosmetic: MQ01Tate could never advance past stage
15, so it never reached stage 40 — the only thing that runs `SetStage MQ01 1` —
and MQ00's completion stage 65 (behind an INFO owned by MQ01) was unreachable
too. `_safe_property_name` now strips a wrapping quote pair, and
`_convert_line` unquotes the dotted member form (`"NQ16"."NQ16CountBooksVar"`,
which previously emitted un-parseable Papyrus because the assignment target and
its value took different code paths). Genuine string literals are untouched.

### `AdvancePCLevel` → the Level actor value (2026-08-01)
<a id="advancepclevel-level-actor-value"></a>

Vanilla `Game.psc` (from `Data/Scripts.zip`) has **no level setter** —
`Game.SetPlayerLevel` exists only in mod-supplied headers, so it will not
compile against the shipped set. `Game.GetPlayer().ModActorValue("Level", 1)` is
the equivalent the base game does offer. Nehrim drives its whole custom level-up
through `AdvancePCLevel` (`GlobaltagebuchScript`'s journal menu), so leaving it
unmapped pinned the player at level 1 forever.

> Check `Data/Scripts.zip`, not `Data/Scripts/Source/`, when asking whether a
> Papyrus native exists: the latter is where mods install their own headers, and
> in this install its `Game.psc` is 454 lines against vanilla's 266.

## Actor promotion must follow the DECLARING type, not the "feels like an actor" test (2026-08-18)
<a id="actor-promotion-must-follow-declaring"></a>

**Symptom:** the Imperial City Arena softlocked. The player arranged a match with
Owyn, walked up the ramp, and the announcer never spoke — so `Arena.GateDownFight`
was never set, the gates never opened, and nothing could advance.

**Cause:** the dedicated `Say` handler resolved its receiver with
`_resolve_self_ref(..., actor_func=True)`, which PROMOTES the receiver's property
to `Actor`. But `Say` is declared on **ObjectReference**:

```
ObjectReference.Say(Topic akTopicToSay, Actor akActorToSpeakAs = None,
                    bool abSpeakInPlayersHead = false)
```

Oblivion exercises that breadth. A census of Oblivion.esm's `Say`/`SayTo`
receivers found **144 calls on 21 non-actor references**: every Daedric shrine
(ACTI), Clavicus' dog statue (MISC), and — the arena case — four **XMarker
(STAT)** refs the announcer talks through: `ArenaMatchPlayerRef`,
`ArenaGalleryMarkerRef`, `ICArenaPlayerMarkerRef`, `ICMonsterFightPlayerRef`.
The announcer is not an NPC standing somewhere; it is an invisible marker
positioned in the arena that the topic is played from.

Declared `Actor Property`, those refuse to bind ("cannot be bound because
`<fid>` is not the right type"), the property comes back **None**, and the first
call on it aborts the whole function. In `ArenaAnnouncerScript` that first call
is `ArenaMatchPlayerRef.GetDistance(Player)` on the very first gate, so the
entire `OnUpdate` body was dead every tick.

This is the same failure the `Unlock` handler already documents. Four handlers
had it:

| Handler | Real declaration | Non-actor subjects in Oblivion.esm |
|---|---|---|
| `say` / `sayto` / `saycustom` | `ObjectReference.Say` | arena XMarkers, Daedric shrines, dog statue |
| `cast` | `Spell.Cast(ObjectReference akSource, …)` | `SEHaskillSummonMarker`, `MG05ShockMark1`, `SE05SpellMarker1-3` |
| `pms` / `sms` | `EffectShader.Play/Stop(ObjectReference)` | `SEXedPuzStatue1-5` |
| `getpos`/`getangle`/`setpos`/`setangle`, `moveto` | all on `ObjectReference` | the Xeddefen puzzle statues, summon markers |

All now use `_resolve_objref_ref`. Whole-plugin `Actor Property`-bound-to-a-
non-actor count went **54 → 3**, and the 3 survivors are `LVLC` refs called with
`evp`, which spawn actors — correct as-is.

**The rule:** promote to `Actor` only when the Papyrus method is declared on
`Actor` and nowhere up the chain. `ObjectReference` is the base type, so anything
declared there must resolve with `_resolve_objref_ref` — no matter how strongly
the TES4 call reads like something only an actor would do. `Say` reads exactly
like an actor-only call and is not one.

**Audit for the whole class** (map REFR/ACHR/ACRE EditorID → base record type,
then flag every `Actor Property <name>` whose named ref has a non-NPC_/CREA
base) — worth re-running after touching any handler that passes
`actor_func=True`.

## `StopQuest` converts to `Stop()` — a "run bit" global does NOT work (2026-08-19)
<a id="stopquest-converts-stop-run-bit"></a>

**The real difference** is that Skyrim's `Quest.Start()` on a stopped quest
RESETS it: every `Auto` property back to its default, stage back to 0.
Oblivion's `StopQuest` clears a run bit and touches nothing, so the authored
idiom "seed the variables, then StartQuest" is safe there and destructive here.

**The hoist alone was not enough (2026-09-24, confirmed in game).**
`hoist_quest_start_above_writes` moves `Start()` above the writes it would
clobber, which saves values seeded in the SAME fragment. It cannot save state
that must outlive a stop/start: `ArenaAggressionScript` picks which combatant
attacks by `Arena.CombatantsKilled`, every match restarts the stopped `Arena`,
and the reset put the counter back to 0 — so from the second match on it armed
`Combatant0ARef` (the first, already dead opponent) and the real opponent was
never told to fight ("second combatant not hostile").

**Fix:** every converted quest script gets a Global
`TES4Start(<script> akQuest)` (`assemble.quest_restart`) that copies each TES4
variable into a typed local, calls `Start()`, and writes them back; a
converted `StartQuest Q` on a quest with a script calls it. The quest script is
the only place that knows each property's final Papyrus type. Global, so the
saved values live in the caller's frame rather than in the instance the restart
replaces. Stop/Start still happen, so stages behave as below. The hoist does
not match this shape and is now inert for scripted quests.

**Also:** the hoist had silently stopped running. The AST rewrite deleted
`_postprocess_lines`, its only call site outside `state_writes_before_setstage`,
so every fragment without a `SetStage` wrote its seeds before `Start()` again —
the announcer-and-gates softlock returned. `emit/script.emit_body` now applies
it to every body.

🛑 **A converter-owned run bit was built and REVERTED (2026-08-19).** The idea:
keep the TES4 run bit in a GLOB `TES4Stopped_<Quest>`, never engine-stop the
quest, and gate dialogue/`GetQuestRunning` on the global — so variables and
stages survive a stop/start cycle exactly as in Oblivion. It preserved the
variables correctly (`CombatantsKilled`/`FirstWin` measured surviving), and it
still broke the Arena, because **a quest that never stops keeps its CURRENT
STAGE**:

* `Arena` has exactly ONE stage, 10 (`AllowRepeatedStages`), whose script
  zeroes the whole match state and then stops the quest.
* Oblivion restages it every match: stopped quest -> `SetStage 10` runs the
  reset again.
* Left engine-running, `Arena` sat at stage 10 permanently. `SetStage(10)` on
  the stage it is already at does nothing, so the reset never re-ran,
  `ReadyMatch` stayed 1, and Owyn's next-match line (gated `ReadyMatch == 0`)
  could never fire — he behaved as though the match had not happened, and the
  gate stayed down. Measured live: `GetStage Arena >> 10`, `ReadyMatch = 1`.

Reverted in full: no `TES4Stopped_*` globals, no INFO stop-gates, no
`GetQuestRunning` expansion, no `IsQuestStopped` poll gate, no
`TES4PersistentActors` FLST / `ResetInterior` polyfill (that rode on the same
design). `StopQuest`/`StartQuest`/`GetQuestRunning` are plain
`Stop()`/`Start()`/`IsRunning()`.

**Kept from that work** (both independently verified): the `Start()` hoist now
also matches a renamed call shape, and `set X.fQuestDelayTime to N` emits
`RegisterForSingleUpdate`, never `RegisterForUpdate` — the latter is a
REPEATING registration and `RegisterForUpdate(0)` shipped in 45 scripts as an
every-frame storm, ended only by the engine stop that the reverted design
removed. Measured on the shipped build: 0 repeating registrations.

## StartCombat retargets an actor already in combat (2026-09-25, confirmed in game)
<a id="startcombat-retargets"></a>

**Symptom:** at the start of "Through the Fringe of Madness" the Gatekeeper
fights the four orc adventurers for a very long time instead of killing them one
by one.

**Cause:** `SE02OrcCaptainScript` keeps every orc invincible until its turn,
then calls `GatekeeperRef.startCombat SE02OrcAdventurerNRef` every frame; that
orc dies on the next Gatekeeper hit (`OnHit SE02GatekeeperNRef → kill`). The
authored code only works because TES4 StartCombat switches an actor that is
already fighting. Skyrim's does not (1.6.1170):

- the `StartCombat` native (0x9eae60) queues task 0x2a; its handler (0x657e1f)
  skips the whole start when the actor's combat controller (`actor+0x160`)
  already lists the target in its group (0x803df0 scans the group's target
  array). All four orcs are hitting him, so every call was a no-op and he kept
  swinging at whichever invincible orc his AI preferred.
- `StopCombat` (0x9eb250) only sets the controller's stop flag (`+0x40`);
  combat ends on its next update, so StopCombat + StartCombat in one call still
  hits the no-op.

**Fix:** `TES4Polyfill.ForceCombat` — when the attacker is in combat with a
different target it calls `StopCombat`, waits (0.05 s steps, 1 s cap) until
`IsInCombat()` is false, then calls `StartCombat`. Generic: every converted
`StartCombat` now retargets as TES4's did.

## ForceCombat keeps the player out of the shared faction pair (2026-09-25, confirmed in game)
<a id="forcecombat-player-faction"></a>

**Symptom:** in the Nehrim intro, Celebro turns hostile around the elevator room
without the player ever hitting him.

**Cause:** `StartCelleAufzugRaumTrigZoneScript` runs `troll.StartCombat Player`,
`troll.StartCombat CelebroRef`, then `CelebroRef.StartCombat troll`. ForceCombat
put the player in `TES4ForceCombatVictims` and Celebro in
`TES4ForceCombatAttackers`. The pair is Enemy both ways, so Celebro (Aggression
1, which attacks Enemies) attacked the player. The memberships are permanent, so
every later forced attacker in the game would also have turned on the player.

**Fix:** when either side is the player, ForceCombat adds the other actor to
vanilla `WIPlayerEnemyFaction` (Skyrim.esm 0x06E02D: Hidden, with one relation,
Enemy of PlayerFaction), which vanilla WI scripts join before `StartCombat` on the
player. Skyrim.esm has 60 such one-purpose player-enemy factions. ForceCombat also
removes the player from both pair factions, which repairs saves made after the old
behavior. The 4-argument signature is unchanged, so already-compiled callers from
other plugins keep working.

## A SetStage that starts a quest keeps its variables (2026-09-25, unconfirmed in game)
<a id="setstage-start-keeps-variables"></a>

`SetStage` on a stopped quest starts it, so it resets the quest script's `Auto`
properties exactly as `Start()` does. TES4 authors write a quest's variables
before its first stage: the Shivering Isles door (`SEDoorToShiveringIslesScript`)
stores the leveled Gatekeeper in `SE02.GatekeeperRef`, and SE02 only starts
later at `SetStage SE02 5` in the waiting room. The start wiped it, and
`SE02OrcCaptainScript` logged `Cannot call IsEssential() on a None object` every
tick. It never made the Gatekeeper invincible, never put him in
`SE02SpecialCombatFaction`, and never started the staged fight.

**Fix:** `SetStage` on a quest with a script converts to
`TES4_<Script>.TES4SetStage(<quest> as TES4_<Script>, N)`. That Global sits beside
`TES4Start`, routes a stopped quest through `TES4Start`, then calls `SetStage`.
`conversation_sequence` recognizes both call shapes.

## ResetInterior sends moved-in references home (2026-09-24, confirmed in game)
<a id="resetinterior-sends-moved-refs-home"></a>

**Symptom:** the previous Arena opponent's corpse still lies in the arena on
the next match.

**Cause:** the 26 combatants are authored in `ArenaCombatantsHolding` and a
match INFO `MoveTo`s one into `ArenaMatchCell`; the reward INFO's
`ResetInterior ArenaMatchCell` cleared the corpse in Oblivion. Skyrim's
`Cell.Reset()` resets only references whose editor location is that cell, so
a moved-in corpse stays.

**Fix:** the authored indicator of "can be in cell C without belonging to it"
is a script's `X.MoveTo M` with the marker M placed in C and X placed
elsewhere. `tes5_import/dialogue/reset_interior.py` writes one FormList
`TES4Movers_<cell>` per cell any script resets, and `ResetInterior C` becomes
`TES4Polyfill.ResetInterior(C, TES4Movers_c)`: each listed reference still in
C goes back via `MoveToMyEditorLocation()`, then `C.Reset()`.

### Renaming a converted call can silently disable a post-pass (2026-08-19)

**Symptom:** after the StopQuest run-bit change, ALL arena dialogue stopped —
no announcer line, no subtitle, and the gate never opened. Regression, not a
new bug.

**Cause:** `_hoist_quest_start_above_writes` exists because Skyrim's
`Quest.Start()` resets every `Auto` property, so the authored TES4 idiom
"seed the variables, then StartQuest" must become "Start, then seed". Its
`_QUEST_START_RE` matched only the literal `Q.Start()` shape. Converting
`StartQuest` to `TES4Polyfill.StartQuest(Q, TES4Stopped_Q)` renamed the call
out from under that regex, the hoist stopped firing, and every seeded write
was clobbered again — **91 writes across 43 scripts** (every arena match INFO,
the arena betting, FGC01), reproducing the exact softlock the hoist was
written to fix. The polyfill still calls `Q.Start()` internally, so the
hazard was unchanged; only the pattern that detected it moved.

**Rule:** when a converted call site changes SHAPE, grep for every post-pass
regex that matches the old shape. A post-pass that silently stops matching
fails open — no error, no warning, just the original bug back.

**Second, independent clobber (same symptom class):** `pipeline.py`'s
`_state_writes_before_setstage` hoists literal state writes ABOVE the first
`SetStage` (so an inline stage fragment's `EvaluatePackage` sees committed
state). That runs AFTER the converter's post-processing, and it can lift a
write above `SetStage` while leaving the `Start()` below it — stranding the
seed again (`ArenaICGrandChampion.CrazyIdea`, 2 sites). Fixed by
re-establishing the invariant on that pass's own output.

**This was a fixpoint re-run until 2026-08-28**, and read like one: the hoist
was called a second time, from a fabricated `ScriptConverter.__new__(...)`
instance (it never touched `self` — only three class-level regexes). Nothing
proved the two reordering passes could not ping-pong. It is now
`tes5.blocks.hoist_quest_start_above_writes`, a module function
`_state_writes_before_setstage` calls on its own result as an ordinary fixup
— the same emitted lines, but a pass repairing what it just did rather than
two passes iterating to agreement.

**Guard:** the invariant is "no write to `Q.<prop>` may precede a `Start()` /
`TES4Polyfill.StartQuest` on the same `Q` within one straight-line run".
Measured on the shipped build: 91 → 0.

## The SCRO table outranks the script TEXT (2026-08-22)
<a id="scro-table-outranks-script-text"></a>

**Oblivion runs the COMPILED script, not the source the CK shows you, and the
two can disagree.** When a record is renamed after its scripts were last
compiled, the source keeps the old name while the compiled form-reference table
(the `SCRO` array) keeps the FormID. The engine reads the FormID, so the stale
spelling is completely invisible in-game.

Converting the TEXT, such a name resolves to nothing. Two failure modes, both
measured:

| Symptom | Where | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Undefined identifier | Knights.esp `TES4_QF_ND00/03/07/09` | CHECKER error → **no `.pex` for the whole script**, so every OTHER stage of the quest dies too |
| Property declared but bound to nothing | Oblivion.esm `TES4_QF_SE02` | compiles fine; the first use ABORTS the fragment (see `project_unbound_vmad_property_aborts`) |

Knights.esp's stage result scripts still read `player.additem NDArmorCuirass 1`
and `player.additem NDLL0WeaponSword 1` while their SCROs bind
`NDArmorHeavyCuirass1` ("Cuirass of the Crusader") and
`NDLL0WeaponSwordLvl100` — these fragments are what hand out the Crusader
relics. Oblivion's SE02 stage 15 reads `startQuest SE02FIN`, a name no record
carries, while the SCRO binds the real quest `SE02Conv`; the Shivering Isles
post-quest dialogue quest was silently never started.

### Recovery is a SET DIFFERENCE, not a positional walk

`pipeline.resolve_scro_aliases()`. The compiler's emission order does **not**
follow source order — `player.additem X` emits the receiver first, so the ND03
stage reads `ND02 / ND02 / ND02 / player / NDArmorCuirass / ND03` against SCROs
`[Player, ND02, NDArmorHeavyCuirass1, ND03]`. A positional walk mis-binds. The
CONTENTS of the table, however, are exact:

- a SCRO whose EditorID the body never spells = a form referenced under some
  other name;
- a body name that resolves to no record = a reference with no form.

**Exactly one of each ⇒ they are the same reference.** Anything less certain
binds nothing.

A prefix rule does not work either: two of the five Knights renames only append
(`NDLL0WeaponSword` → `…Lvl100`) but `NDArmorCuirass` → `NDArmorHeavyCuirass1`
inserts a word in the middle.

### Tokenising the body — the two traps

- **Command names must be dropped** (`low in FUNCTION_MAP`): a command is not a
  form. Otherwise `setstage` looks like an unresolvable name.
- **Quoted EditorIDs must be KEPT, quotes stripped.** Oblivion's parser accepts
  quotes around any EditorID and vanilla uses them. Stripping the whole literal
  made TG03Elven's `PlaceAtMe "TG03LlathasasBust"` look unspelled, and that
  stage's `IsXBox` — an OBSE command with no `FUNCTION_MAP` entry — looked like
  the rename it paired with. It would have bound a variable to a statue.

### Measured selectivity

| Plugin | fragments scanned | aliases fired |
|---|---|---|
| Oblivion.esm | 9,892 (2,393 SCPT + 1,870 QUST stages + 5,629 INFO) | **1** (SE02FIN → SE02Conv, a true rename) |
| Knights.esp | 495 (194 SCPT + 146 QUST stages + 155 INFO) | **5**, across the four failing quests (ND00 twice, ND03, ND07, ND09) |

Oblivion's other 22 stage scripts with unresolvable names have **no** unspelled
SCRO — master-owned records and local variables, correctly left alone. Full
Oblivion `--scripts-only` rebuild after the change: 16,518/16,518 compile, and
exactly ONE of the 16,518 `.psc` files differs from the pre-change baseline.

### Handlers that name a property directly need their own hook

`_convert_ref` and the bare-identifier path in `_convert_expression` both
consult the alias map, but `startquest`/`stopquest`/`getquestrunning` build the
property name themselves via `_safe_property_name` and bypass both — that is
why SE02 still emitted `SE02FIN.Start()` after the first fix. Any new handler
that skips `_convert_ref` must call `_scro_alias_for()` itself.

## Zero-argument commands must be ROUTED or they survive undefined
<a id="zero-argument-commands-must-be"></a>

A command taking no arguments is ALWAYS read bare, so it never reaches
`_emit_function` through the call path — it must be in `_BARE_NO_EQUIV_COMMANDS`
(with a `FUNCTION_MAP` entry) or the name reaches the compiler as an undefined
identifier and fails the CHECKER. Added 2026-08-22:

- `getcurrentweatherpercent` — the spelled-out form of `getweatherpercent`, used
  by Knights' `ND08WraithSCRIPT`. Both now reach the real handler and return
  `Weather.GetCurrentWeatherTransition()` (0..1). `getweatherpercent` was
  previously caught by a stub list that returned a constant `0`, which made
  every `< 0.1` "still transitioning" test permanently true.
- `isplayerslastriddenhorse` — the other authored spelling of
  `GetPlayerHasLastRiddenHorse` (both are engine function `0x1153`, confirmed via
  `tools/misc/uesp_lookup.py`). No Skyrim equivalent; neutralised to `0` with an
  `;NE:` marker.

## A raw FormID in a FORM-ARGUMENT slot is never a numeric literal
<a id="raw-formid-form-argument-slot"></a>

`_convert_expression`'s bare-identifier path only reinterprets a **6-8 digit**
token as a FormID, because anywhere else a short run of digits is an ordinary
number. In an argument slot the engine reads as a FORM there is no such
ambiguity, and the LOW ids are the ones scripts write by hand: Knights'
`ND10TimeStopSpellScript` tests `GetIsID 7`, i.e. the Player NPC_ at
`0x00000007`.

Left a literal it produced `Form == Int` (checker error, no `.pex`) plus a
phantom `Form Property d7` — `_safe_property_name` prefixing the digit.
`_form_operand_edid()` resolves any 1-8 digit token in such a slot.

**An `ActorBase`-typed `Player` property must bind to `0x7`, not `0x14`.** Both
binders (`dialog_converter`, `object_scripts`) hardcoded the reference id; the VM
refuses a reference into an `ActorBase` property and the script's whole init
aborts. Skyrim's Player ActorBase is `0x00000007`, the same id as TES4's.

## TES4's destroyed flag has no Papyrus READER — mirror it in a FormList (2026-08-27)
<a id="tes4s-destroyed-flag-has-no"></a>

**Symptom.** Closing the Kvatch Oblivion gate teleported the player out
correctly, but the gate stayed standing and MS48 never advanced past stage 10.

**Cause.** `MS48OblivionGateScript`'s only `setstage ms48 50` is gated on
`getdestroyed == 1`:

```
begin gamemode
  if getdisabled == 1
    return
  endif
  if getdestroyed == 1 && getstage ms48 < 50
    setstage ms48 50
  endif
```

**What `SetDestroyed` actually does**, per the CK wiki's own page:

> "Objects that have been Destroyed no longer present mouseover text and
> cannot be activated. Note that they still exist, and continue to render and
> process events normally — they are **not Disabled or Deleted**, and their
> visual **Destruction State, if any, is unaffected**."

So it is *only* non-interactability. Three states share the word "destroyed"
and are all distinct — in Oblivion.exe they are literally different bits of
`[ref+8]`:

| State | Oblivion bit | Read in Papyrus by |
|---|---|---|
| destroyed **flag** | `0x2000` | *(no member — see below)* |
| enable state | `0x800` | `IsDisabled()` |
| DEST destruction **stage** | *(not a flag)* | `GetCurrentDestructionStage()` |

**Availability of the reader.** Skyrim exposes the setter to Papyrus
(`ObjectReference.psc:553`) but **not** the getter. `GetDestroyed` is real —
it is a console command (`0x10CB` / 4299) and a condition function (CTDA
index 203, no params, per xEdit `wbDefinitionsTES5.pas:336`) — but it has no
`ObjectReference` member: **0 hits across every vanilla `.psc`**, and it is
absent from the CK wiki's ObjectReference member list.

The CTDA route is not usable either, and not worth building: **0 of 134,748
conditions** across all 16 exported plugins use function 203.

**This conversion never writes a DEST subrecord** (grep `tes5_import/` — the
signature appears only in comments), so `GetCurrentDestructionStage()` returns
0 for *every* converted record. Both spellings of `getdestroyed` were
therefore dead reads that could never become true, and every quest advancing
off its own destruction was stuck.

**Do not shadow it in a script Actor Value.** `SetActorValue`/`GetActorValue`
are declared on `Actor.psc` (lines 521/143), **not** on `ObjectReference`, so
they do not compile against the things TES4 destroys — the Kvatch gate is a
`DOOR`, and the rest are activators, statics and trap triggers.

**The fix.** A conversion-owned FormList, `TES4DestroyedRefs`:

* `tes5_import._create_destroyed_formlist` mints it at
  `writer.chargen_fid_base + 0x44`, in the already-reserved 0x800 gap beside
  the ForceCombat FACT pair — a fixed slot, so **no FormID drift**.
* `TES4Polyfill.SetDestroyed(ref, list, bool)` calls the real native *and*
  mirrors the write into the list; `GetDestroyed(ref, list)` reads it back.
  `AddForm` / `HasForm` / `RemoveAddedForm` are native and work on any
  reference type, and script-added entries persist in the save.
* Every writer routes through the polyfill — `setdestroyed` is a special
  handler in `converter.py`, **not** a `constants.py` direct-native mapping.
  A direct mapping there silently bypasses the mirror and reproduces the bug.
* `CloseCurrentOblivionGate` / `CloseOblivionGate` / `DestroyAfterAnimation`
  all take the list and go through the same setter.

**Measured in the built artifacts (Oblivion.esm):** FLST `0118E17B`
`TES4DestroyedRefs`; 138 `SetDestroyed` writers, 26 `GetDestroyed` readers and
19 `DestroyAfterAnimation` calls across 69 scripts; 89 VMAD properties, all
bound to `0118E17B`, none misbound; zero remaining bare-native writes and zero
`GetCurrentDestructionStage` reads. `DOOR 011778C8` (MS48OblivionGate) and the
sigil-stone scripts are both bound, so the read and the write meet.

It is general, not gate-specific: tripwires, breakaway planks, cave-ins,
pressure plates, crumbling walls, Elven statues, the MQ06 Paradise portal and
all 20 gate-closing scripts use the same mechanism, including the
`setDestroyed 0` re-arm path (`TES4Polyfill.SetDestroyed(Self, list, false)`).

## Closing an Oblivion gate is the destroyed FLAG and nothing else (2026-08-27)
<a id="closing-oblivion-gate-destroyed-flag"></a>

Decompiled from `Oblivion.exe` (the Nehrim install), so this is the engine's
own answer rather than an inference:

| | Address | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `CloseOblivionGate` handler | `0x515ef0` | opcode `0x10DE` |
| `CloseCurrentOblivionGate` handler | `0x515d20` | opcode `0x10C0` |
| destroyed-flag setter | `0x46aa50` | `or [ref+8], 0x2000` / `and ...,~0x2000` |
| `GetDestroyed` handler | `0x4f82c0` | `[ref+8] >> 0xD & 1` — same bit |
| `Disable` handler | `0x50a240` | tests/sets bit `0x800` — a DIFFERENT flag |

Walking every call target transitively from `0x515ef0`: the flag setter
`0x46aa50` **is** reachable; `Disable` `0x50a240` is **not**, at any depth.
So closing a gate sets one bit and does nothing else.

**Then why does the gate visibly disappear?** Because the visible portal is an
*animation*, not the reference's presence. The gate NIF
(`Oblivion\Gate\OblivionArchGate01.NIF`) carries exactly three sequences —
`Forward`, `Backward`, `SpecialIdle` — and the gate's own `GameMode` re-issues
the looping one only while it is not destroyed:

```
if GetDisabled == 0 && GetDestroyed == 0
    if IsAnimPlaying == 0
        playgroup specialidle 1
```

Once the flag is set that branch stops running, the loop is no longer
re-issued, and the portal closes itself. UESP's "the gate ... disappearing" is
describing this, not a `Disable`.

**Do NOT `Disable()` the gate.** Two independent reasons:

1. Oblivion never does (measured above), and Bethesda's own MQ14 stage script
   closes three gates with bare `CloseOblivionGate` while disabling only a
   *sound* marker (`MQ13Gate2Sound.disable`) — proof they reached for
   `.disable` when they wanted it, and did not here.
2. It would break the quest. The gate's poll opens with
   `if getdisabled == 1 / return`, *above* the `getdestroyed` stage check, so
   a disabled gate can never run its own `setstage`.

It is also not available: Skyrim refuses `Disable()` on a reference with an
enable-state parent (`SkyrimSE.exe`: "cannot disable an object with an enable
state parent" — and symmetrically "cannot enable ..."), and `MS48KvatchGate`
has `XESP.Reference=00091229`. Disabling that parent instead is wrong too —
`MQ13CountessBattleMarker` parents all four MQ13 gates, so it would close
gates the script left open.



## Script conversion: known defects found during the parse-tree rewrite
<a id="script-conversion-known-defects"></a>

The `script_convert/` rewrite (see the parse-tree plan) reproduces **current
behaviour, bugs included** — the tree path emits the same wrong thing the regex
path emits, and defects are recorded here instead of being fixed inline. Fixing
is separate work, done on a foundation where the fix is one transform rather
than one more repair pass.

Each entry says how it was measured and what is *not* yet known, so nothing here
gets treated as more certain than it is.

---

## 1. Cross-plugin script types are a BUILD-ORDER dependency (measured 2026-08-28)
<a id="1-cross-plugin-script-types"></a>

**Status:** not a runtime defect. Recorded because it is invisible to both
whole-tree repair passes and will matter to stage 5.

A converted script can declare a property typed as a script owned by another
plugin, which its own output directory does not contain:

| Plugin | Distinct missing script types | Property declarations | Files |
|---|---|---|---|
| Translation.esp | 165 | 830 | 179 |
| Knights.esp | 14 | 42 | 25 |
| Morrowind_ob.esm | 5 | 10 | 4 |
| **Nehrim.esm** | **0** | 0 | 0 |
| **Oblivion.esm** | **0** | 0 | 0 |

The split is exact: **every plugin with masters has them; both standalone
plugins have none.** Examples — `TES4_AltaroftheNine`, `TES4_FXDustFall01SCRIPT`
and `TES4_TG03Main` are declared by `Knights.esp` scripts and defined in
`Oblivion.esm`; `TES4_HMSfromFloat24h` is declared by
`Translation.esp/TES4_AAWaitMenuActorScript.psc` (which calls `.TES4Call()` on
it three times, from OBSE `Call HMSfromFloat24h GameHour`) and defined in
`Nehrim.esm`.

**Verified**: every one of the sampled missing types IS generated into its
owning plugin's output (`TES4_AltaroftheNine.psc` etc. are present under
`output/Oblivion.esm/`), and all plugins deploy to the same `Data/Scripts/`
folder, so the `.pex` resolves at runtime. `tools/script/compile_papyrus.py`
already carries `--extra-headers` for exactly this case.

**Not yet known**: whether every one of the 165 Translation.esp types resolves
(only a sample was checked), and whether a *compile* of one plugin in isolation
fails without `--extra-headers`. Neither affects a full-pipeline build.

**Why it matters to the rewrite**: `_comment_undeclared_identifiers` cannot see
this class at all — the property *is* declared, it is just typed as a script
absent from this output tree. A symbol table spanning plugins can check it; the
grep passes cannot.

---

## 2. Shadowed command handlers in `_emit_function` (measured, pre-existing)
<a id="2-shadowed-command-handlers-emitfunction"></a>

Six TES4 command names have two competing branches in the 201-branch chain, one
of them unreachable. Dated with `git log -L`, they split into two opposite
kinds:

**(a) Superseded corpses — safe to delete, zero output change.** The
earlier-in-file branch is the *newer* commit; a better handler was added above
the old one and the corpse left below: `getpcisrace` (L7338 shadows L8166),
`ispcexpelled`/`getpcexpelled` (L6391 shadows L8016), `isexpelled`, `expel`
(L7380 shadows L8008).

**(b) Unreachable NEW code of UNKNOWN correctness.** Commit `fd04769`
(2026-07-28, "handle OBSE extensions") added implementations that an older stub
~1,100 lines above silently defeats:

- **`forceflee`** — the new branch emits `SetActorValue("Confidence", 0)` +
  `EvaluatePackage()`; the April stub at L7299 returns `;NE: ForceFlee` + `0`
  and wins. Its sibling name `flee`, added in the same commit, **does** reach
  the new code — so one commit's two names behave differently today.
- **`positioncell`** — the new branch emits `SetPosition(x,y,z)` + `SetAngle`;
  the 2026-07-20 stub at L6604 wins. `positionworld` works, `positioncell`
  returns `0`.

**This code has never executed.** It was shadowed at birth, so it has never
produced a line of output or been seen in game, and its rationale comment is an
argument rather than evidence — it is *not* known to be better than the stub it
lost to. Enabling it changes output and needs an in-game test; it is out of
scope for the rewrite.

**A precedence inversion, not a duplicate**: `getbookread` is in `_NO_OP_FUNCS`
(L7477) but `bookread` is not, so the membership test at L7500 claims
`getbookread` and the later L8503 branch is reachable only for `bookread`.
Deleting that branch wholesale would change `bookread`'s emitted comment text;
only the `'getbookread'` tuple entry may be removed.

---

## 3. Two latent scanner bugs — both FIXED in stage 3 (measured 2026-08-28)
<a id="3-two-latent-scanner-bugs"></a>

Found while replacing the hand-rolled scanners with the lexer. Both were cases
where the old character-level code did the wrong thing on input the corpus
happens not to contain, so neither changed emitted output — verified by a
zero-diff rebuild of all 38,612 scripts across four plugins after each fix.

**`_split_logical` was not quote-aware.** It tracked parenthesis depth but not
string state, so `MessageBox "a || b"` split into two parts. Verified over
413,210 comparisons: no corpus script has `||` or `&&` inside a string literal.
**Fixed** — the parser-based replacement is quote-aware by construction.

**Two regexes missed digit-leading EditorIDs.** An Oblivion EditorID may start
with a digit (`"1TrapFireMineWorldRef"`, `"2akulaSdoorSa"` — 118 lines, 16
distinct ids, across Nehrim, Morrowind_ob and Translation), but both
`_QUOTED_MEMBER_RE` and `_QUOTED_NAME_RE` required a letter or underscore
first, so those kept their quotes. Only `_safe_property_name` saved them: it
strips the quotes *and* prefixes the `d` that makes the name legal Papyrus, so
quoted and unquoted spellings happened to normalize to the same property
(verified for all 12 sampled ids). Anything reading the name without going
through it would have hit the `_MQ01Tate_` failure that
`_QUOTED_NAME_RE`'s own comment describes — a property bound to nothing,
throwing at every use.

**Fixed** — both name classes widened to `\w+`, and `_unquote_identifiers`
now delegates to `parser.unquote_member_names`, where "a quoted name touching
a `.`" is a structural test rather than a lookahead/lookbehind pair with a
second character class to keep in sync. Verified identical on all 206,612
source lines before the substitution.

**A non-finding, recorded so it is not re-investigated:**
`d1TrapFireMineWorldRef.MoveTo(d1TrapFireMineWorldRef)` looks like an object
being moved to itself, but it is the deliberate conversion of TES4
`Reset3DState` (`converter.py`, `fname_low == 'reset3dstate'`) — `MoveTo(self)`
is the Skyrim idiom for forcing a 3D reset.

---

## 4. Authored typos in source scripts (measured, not our bug)
<a id="4-authored-typos-source-scripts"></a>

The parser degrades an unparseable line to a `Raw` node rather than failing the
script — Oblivion's own compiler was permissive, and a script that fails to
convert takes down every other script declaring a property of its type. Across
all 19,013 script bodies in 10 plugins there are **17** such lines, every one an
authored typo:

- `MG09Script` line 132 (Oblivion.esm): a stray `` ` `` after `endif`.
- `SE09BodyPartActivatorScript` (Oblivion.esm): a bare `:` where the author
  meant `;`, so a comment line lexes as code.
- `AkarusScript`, `MelvinScript`, `AchievementsQuestScript` (Nehrim.esm): bare
  `-----` / `:= == ==` separator lines with no leading `;`.

No action needed; recorded so a future session does not re-investigate them.

---

## 5. Divergent block scanners in the repair passes — FIXED in stage 4 (measured 2026-08-28)
<a id="5-divergent-block-scanners-repair"></a>

Four post-emit passes each re-derived Papyrus block structure from text, with
their own keyword spellings, and disagreed. The disagreements were invisible
because they only bite on shapes the emitter does not currently produce —
exactly the class of latent defect §3 records.

**`_remove_dead_code_after_return` did not know `If(`.** `_balance_if_endif`
matched `if ` *and* `if(`; the dead-code pass matched only `if `. So a `Return`
inside an `If(x)` block counted as top-level, and **every statement after that
block was rewritten to `;  <line>  ;dead code after Return`** — live code
silently commented out, including the `EndIf` itself:

    Event A()          old ->  Event A()
    If(x)                      If(x)
    Return                     Return
    EndIf                      ;  EndIf  ;dead code after Return
    foo                        ;  foo  ;dead code after Return
    EndEvent                   EndEvent

**A third divergence, same shape**: `_hoist_quest_start_above_writes` carried
its own barrier list (`_HOIST_STOP_RE`) which matched a bare `Function` but
not a typed `Int Function` header — so a `Quest.Start()` could in principle
hoist ACROSS a function boundary into an unrelated body. Also unreachable:
walking back from all 40,586 files' `Start()` sites crosses a typed header
**0 times**. A 200,000-case randomised differential found the loop rewrite
byte-equivalent to the old cursor loop once the barrier was held constant,
and every divergence with it unpinned was this hardening.

**Not currently reachable**: censused all 40,586 generated `.psc` — **0 lines**
begin `If(`, `While(` or `ElseIf(`; the emitter always writes a space. The
pass also missed `While(` openers and typed `Int Function` headers (which
`_balance_if_endif` did handle), both harmless for the same reason.

**Fixed** — `script_convert/tes5/blocks.py` classifies an emitted line once
(`classify`) and resolves depth/stack once (`scan`); the passes consume `Line`
records and no longer mention a keyword. A future emitter change to `If(` now
lands on every pass at once instead of on one of them. Verified: the
scan-based rewrite is byte-identical to the old logic on all 40,586 files, and
a 24-case adversarial suite of unbalanced input agrees everywhere except this
bug.

---

## 6. Two divergent boolean-function lists (measured 2026-08-28)
<a id="6-two-divergent-boolean-function"></a>

`_BARE_BOOL_FUNCTIONS` (constants.py, 21 names) and the `_BOOL_FUNC_NAMES`
regex inside `_convert_expression` (34 names) both answer *"does this TES4
function return a boolean?"* — and agree on only **10**. Which collapse a call
receives depends on which list happens to name it: `ref.IsDisabled == 1`
collapses to `ref.IsDisabled()`, `ref.GetDetected == 1` does not.

**Reachable, and wide**: 24 names are in the regex only, used **3,577 times
across 1,944 scripts** (`isactionref` 1,597, `getincell` 688, `getstagedone`
447). 11 names are in `_BARE_BOOL_FUNCTIONS` only.

**Deliberately NOT fixed during the parse-tree rewrite.** Unifying the lists
changes ~1,944 scripts, which would swamp the rewrite's semantic-diff gate and
make an emitter bug indistinguishable from this fix. The rewrite's expression
emitter reads ONE table (`_BARE_BOOL_FUNCTIONS`), so the union lands as a
one-line table edit once the rewrite is verified — at which point the diff is
attributable and reviewable on its own.

---

## 7. `this` → `Self` substitution leaked INTO string literals — FIXED by the tree emitter (2026-08-28)
<a id="7-this-self-substitution-leaked"></a>

`_convert_expression`'s terminal substitution pass rewrites the TES4 keyword
`this` to Papyrus `Self` with a regex over the whole expression **text**, so it
also fires inside a quoted string:

```
authored:  "... Almalexia.esp detected. This file is deprecated ..."
shipped:   "... Almalexia.esp detected.Self file is deprecated ..."
```

Both the space and the word are destroyed, in **player-facing** message text.

**Measured**: 9 lines, all in `TES4_mwFnCheckInstallation.psc` (Morroblivion's
installation-warning banner). Narrow only because few converted scripts build
long English sentences.

**Fixed** by the parse-tree emitter, structurally rather than by a better
regex: a `Literal` node with `is_string` set is emitted verbatim and no
substitution pass can reach inside it. This is the class of defect the rewrite
exists to make unrepresentable — the same shape as the `;NE:`-inside-an-
expression family.

---

## 8. A local variable named like a built-in was shadowed by the FUNCTION — FIXED by the tree emitter (2026-08-28)
<a id="8-local-variable-named-like"></a>

`fbmwMercCalvusScript` declares `short isdead` and later tests `if isdead == 1`.
Oblivion resolves that to the VARIABLE — a local always wins over a command
name. The string path checked its boolean-function tables before its local
table, so it emitted the call instead:

```
authored:  short isdead   ...   if isdead == 1
shipped:   If (Self as Actor).IsDead()      ← reads the ACTOR, not the variable
correct:   If isdead                        ← reads the declared property
```

The script also declares `Int Property isdead Auto Conditional`, so the
emitted call ignored a property the quest actually writes.

**Fixed** by the parse-tree emitter, which resolves a bare `Ident` against the
script's own declarations before consulting any command table. Found by the
semantic diff (`calls[isdead/0]: 1 -> None`), not by a compile failure — the
old output compiled perfectly and simply did the wrong thing.

**Scope**: 1 script measured across the four verified plugins. Narrow because
few TES4 authors name a variable after a command.

---

## 9. `SetPos <axis>, <value>` wrote the WRONG AXIS — FIXED (2026-08-28)
<a id="9-setpos-axis-value-wrote"></a>

TES4 separates arguments with whitespace, a comma, or both, so
`Ref.SetPos Z, PlacePosZ` is as legal as `Ref.SetPos Z PlacePosZ`. The
handler split on whitespace only:

```python
parts = args_str.split(None, 1)      # 'Z, PlacePosZ' -> ['Z,', 'PlacePosZ']
axis  = parts[0].upper()             # 'Z,'  -- not in {X, Y, Z}
```

`'Z,'` fails the axis test and the lookup falls back to its X default, so the
value is written to the **X** coordinate:

```
authored:  Ref.SetPos Z, PlacePosZ
shipped:   Ref.SetPosition(PlacePosZ, Ref.GetPositionY(), Ref.GetPositionZ())
correct:   Ref.SetPosition(Ref.GetPositionX(), Ref.GetPositionY(), PlacePosZ)
```

**Measured**: 27 sites in 10 scripts across the four verified plugins,
including Morroblivion's `JDLevitate` and `mwRotationFix` and Nehrim's
`1MarkFxEffectScript`. `SetAngle` shares the handler and the defect.

**Fixed** by splitting on `,`-or-whitespace. Found by the statement
differential — the tree path joins arguments with `", "` and produced the
correct axis, which made the old path's output the outlier.

---

## 10. `GetLOS` was listed as taking no arguments — FIXED (2026-08-28)
<a id="10-getlos-was-listed-as"></a>

`_ZERO_ARG_REF_FUNCTIONS` exists so that `StopCombat, Player` resolves to
`Player.StopCombat()` — for a command that takes nothing, the token after a
leading comma is the RECEIVER, not an argument.

`getlos` was in that set, and it takes a TARGET: `GetLOS, Player` asks
whether **Self** can see the player. Promoting the argument inverted the
question and dropped it:

```
authored:  if ( GetLOS, Player == 1 )
wrong:     Game.GetPlayer().HasLOS()      ← the PLAYER's line of sight, to nothing
correct:   (Self as Actor).HasLOS(Game.GetPlayer())
```

It does not even compile ("function takes 1 parameters not 0"), which is how
it surfaced: **9 Nehrim scripts** failed once the parse tree started
preserving the leading comma. Before that the comma was discarded upstream,
so the promotion never fired and the bad table entry was inert.

**Fixed** by removing `getlos` from the set. Audited the other 61 entries
against their argument counts; it was the only one wrong.

---

## 11. Multi-button `MessageBox` degraded to a plain text box — FIXED (2026-08-28)
<a id="11-multi-button-messagebox-degraded"></a>

`_convert_function_call` split a command line with two regexes:

```python
ref_m = re.match(r'^(\w+)\.(\w+)\s*(.*)', stripped, re.IGNORECASE)
func_m = re.match(r'^(\w+)\s*(.*)', stripped, re.IGNORECASE)
```

The argument tail then reached `_emit_function` as raw TEXT, and every handler
re-split it — on whitespace, on commas, or on both. That tears a quoted
argument apart at the first separator inside it, and a `MessageBox` is
mostly quoted arguments:

```
authored:  messagebox "Do you steer by the stars of the Lover?", "No", "Yes"
shipped:   Debug.MessageBox("Do you steer by the stars of the Lover?")
correct:   TES4_MsgButton = TES4_ShowMsg(TES4Msg_DoomstoneLoverScriptNEW_01)
```

The buttons were dropped, so the box became a notification the player could
only dismiss — the Doomstone asks a question that could never be answered.

**Measured**: 39 button menus restored and 81 `Message` properties added
across the four verified plugins. The same split also ate the space after a
sentence-ending period (`"...the crowd.He screams for help."`) in 232 strings,
because the tail was re-joined with single spaces after being split.

**Fixed** by PARSING the line instead: `_convert_function_call` now builds a
`Call` node and hands `_emit_function` the parsed `args`, so arguments are
separated once, by the parser, and a quoted literal is one token.

---

## 12. `pms <shader>, <n>` created a second, unbound property — FIXED (2026-08-28)
<a id="12-pms-shader-n-created"></a>

Branches read their first argument as `args_str.strip().split()[0]`, which
keeps the SEPARATOR on the token when the source uses the comma form. The
name then went through `_safe_property_name`, which sanitises the comma to an
underscore:

```
pms effectDrain 5   ->  property `effectDrain`
pms effectDrain, 5  ->  property `effectDrain_`     ← a different property
```

Both spellings mean the same shader, so a script using both declared two
properties for one record and only one of them was ever bound.

**Fixed** by the `arg_src()` / `arg_srcs()` accessors, which read the parsed
argument nodes; the separator is gone before the name is seen. Affects
`pms`, `sms`, `pme`, `sme` and `showmap`.

---

## 13. Twelve commands were treated as unknown by the node path — FIXED (2026-08-28)
<a id="13-twelve-commands-were-treated"></a>

`_is_known_command` gates whether `name <args>` is a call at all; an unknown
name becomes `;TODO:` over the whole line. It tested a hand-kept list of
tables, and the branch chain in `_emit_function` had grown twelve names that
appeared in none of them — `setforcerun`, `resethealth`, `setgamesetting`,
`getcrosshairreference` and nine others.

While only the string path reached the command layer this was invisible: that
path never asked the question. Routing statements through the node path made
it live, and `setforcerun 1` — the SpeedMult write — became `;TODO:` in 62
statements.

**Fixed** by deriving `_BRANCH_ONLY_COMMANDS` from the chain itself rather
than maintaining a parallel list. `foreach` is deliberately excluded: it is a
statement keyword intercepted before the command layer.

---

## 14. `GetDayOfWeek` had two conversions and the worse one won — FIXED (2026-08-28)
<a id="14-getdayofweek-had-two-conversions"></a>

The command was converted in two places that did not agree:

| Path | Emitted |
|---|---|
| `FIXED_PROPERTY_CALLS` (a call) | `(GameDaysPassed.GetValueInt() % 7)` |
| a branch in the bare-identifier path | `(GameDaysPassed.GetValue() as Int) % 7` |

`GetValue()` returns Float, so the second form typed the whole expression
Float. Assigning it to a TES4 `short` then attracted a SECOND cast:

```
DayofLastUse = (GameDaysPassed.GetValue() as Int) % 7 as Int
```

Which spelling a script got depended only on whether the author wrote the
command bare or as a call — the same command, two answers.

**Measured**: 42 call sites across Knights.esp and Morrowind_ob.esm.

**Fixed** by deleting the duplicate branch and routing both spellings
(`getdayofweek`, `getdayoftheweek`) to the table. Found by the S1 typing
harness: `symbols.type_of_expr` typed the expression Int from the tree while
the old text scan typed it Float, and the disagreement was the bug.

---

## 15. `FUNCTION_MAP` silently drops 20 entries — LATENT (2026-08-28)
<a id="15-functionmap-silently-drops-20"></a>

The literal has **537 keys but evaluates to 517**: 17 keys are written more
than once and Python keeps only the last. Four of them carry *different*
values, so a working mapping is overwritten by `(None, ...)`:

| Key | Earlier | Later (wins) |
|---|---|---|
| `getcontainer` | `('GetContainer', True, None)` | `(None, True, None)` |
| `setdoordefaultopen` | `('SetOpen', True, None)` | `(None, True, None)` |
| `setdisplayname` | `('SetDisplayName', True, None)` | `(None, True, None)` |
| `getinfame` | `(None, False, None)` | `(None, True, None)` |

**Not currently a live defect**: three of the four are rescued by an explicit
branch in `_emit_function` (which is *why* those branches exist), and
`setdisplayname` correctly degrades because Skyrim needs SKSE for it. But the
duplicates are invisible, and a future edit to the earlier entry would have no
effect. To be resolved when the command tables merge into one row per command,
where a duplicate key is detectable.

---

## 16. Two disagreeing lists of Bool-returning Papyrus names — FIXED (2026-08-28)
<a id="16-two-disagreeing-lists-bool"></a>

The same fact — "does this Papyrus function return Bool" — was recorded twice:

| Where | Form |
|---|---|
| `constants.PAPYRUS_BOOL_FUNCTIONS` | a `set` of 53 names |
| `converter._BOOL_FUNC_NAMES` | a regex alternation of 33 names |

They disagreed by **twelve names** — `IsDetectedBy`, `HasLOS`, `CanSee`,
`GetDetected`, `IsAnimPlaying`, `IsRidingMount`, `IsHostileToActor`,
`IsWeaponDrawn`, `IsChild`, `IsAlarmed`, `IsCompleted`, `IsObjectiveCompleted`
— so whether a Bool got its `as Int` depended on which list the code path
happened to consult. `Temp = Player.IsDetectedBy(x)` reached the set (which
lacked it), got no cast, and failed to compile:

```
Checker error: value with type `Bool` cannot be assigned to a variable with type `Int`
```

**Fixed** by merging the twelve into `PAPYRUS_BOOL_FUNCTIONS` and DERIVING the
regex from it, so there is one list. A side effect, and the intended one: a
`GetLOS Player == 0` now knows its left side is Bool and collapses to
`!(...HasLOS(Player))` instead of comparing a Bool to `0` — 21 scripts.

**Also fixed in the same pass**: `RETURN_TYPES` is keyed by the bare Papyrus
method, but `FUNCTION_MAP` maps some commands to a QUALIFIED name
(`rand` -> `Utility.RandomFloat`). Without stripping the class prefix,
`set randint to Rand 1 5` looked untyped and lost its cast in 4 Morroblivion
scripts.

## 17. Type coercion guessed from emitted text — REPLACED (2026-08-28)
<a id="17-type-coercion-guessed-from"></a>

`_coerce_float_to_int` decided whether an assignment needed `as Int` by
running four scans over the ALREADY-EMITTED Papyrus: a Float-function regex,
a `\d+\.\d+` literal probe, an identifier sweep looking up each name, and a
Bool-function regex. All four re-derive the value's type from its rendering,
where a command name inside a string literal counts as a call and the shape of
the arithmetic is invisible.

Replaced by `symbols.type_of_expr`, which types the value from its PARSE TREE
before any text exists. Verified by differential harness over the corpus:

| Plugin | Assignments to Int targets | Disagreements |
|---|---|---|
| Oblivion.esm | 1,076 | 0 |
| Nehrim.esm | 1,133 | 0 |
| Morrowind_ob.esm | 1,414 | 0 |
| Knights.esp | 570 | 0 |

Getting to zero is what surfaced §14 and §16 — both were cases where the tree
and the text scan disagreed, and the tree was right.

## 18. Operator precedence encoded twice, and the copies disagreed — LATENT (2026-08-29)
<a id="18-operator-precedence-encoded-twice"></a>

`tes4/parser._PRECEDENCE` (six tiers, which the parser BINDS by) and
`emit/expr._PRECEDENCE_RANK` (five ranks, which the emitter PARENTHESISES by)
were written out separately and did not match: the parser gives `==` and `<`
their own tiers, the emitter collapsed both to rank 2.

The emitter parenthesises a child only when it binds LOOSER than its parent, so
the disagreement drops the parens on an equality nested under a relational
operator. `(a == b) < c` emitted as `a == b < c`, which Papyrus re-reads as
`a == (b < c)` — a different expression. Twelve operator pairs changed
parenthesisation once the tables were unified.

**Not observed in any script.** Censused all 6,364 exported TES4 scripts, 4,010
of which use a relational operator: **zero** occurrences of the shape. It cannot
change current output, which is why the semantic diff is unmoved.

Fixed by deriving both from `tes4/lexer.PRECEDENCE` — the lowest layer the
parser and the emitter both reach (`tes4/*` is stdlib-only, so `constants.py`
was not available).

---

## 19. `Activate` drops its arguments when the caller passes nodes — LATENT (2026-08-29)
<a id="19-activate-drops-its-arguments"></a>

The `activate` branch read its arguments as

```python
parts = self.arg_srcs(args_str) if args_str else []
```

`arg_srcs` reads the parsed argument NODES, but the guard tests the parallel
SOURCE-TEXT channel. A caller supplying nodes with an empty `args_str` would
have had every argument silently discarded — the activator and the run-flag
both lost, emitting a no-argument `Activate()`.

**Not reachable today**: measured 0 occurrences over 6,082 scripts, because the
only caller that supplies nodes also built the text. It was one caller away, and
removing the second channel (both are now derived from the nodes) makes it
unreachable by construction rather than by luck.

## 20. Feature flags scanned from raw source matched COMMENTS — FIXED (2026-08-29)
<a id="20-feature-flags-scanned-from"></a>

Six per-script flags were set by scanning the lowercased source as text:

```python
self._uses_timer = bool(re.search(r'\btimer\b', source_low))
self._uses_say   = bool(re.search(r'\bsay(?:to)?\b', source_low))
```

A text scan cannot tell a call from the same letters inside a comment or a
string literal. Measured over 6,082 exported scripts, tree-derived facts against
the text scans:

| Flag | Scripts the text scan got wrong |
|---|---|
| `uses_timer` | **122** |
| `uses_say` | 8 |
| `uses_getsecondspassed` | 7 |
| `elapsed_is_realtime` | 6 |
| `uses_say_timer` | 1 |

Every difference is the same direction — the scan says true, the tree says
false — and every sample is a COMMENT: `;Timer for pirate placement`,
`;Float Timer`, whole commented-out `;Begin GameMode` blocks.

`_uses_timer` picks the poll interval in `_get_update_interval`, so **122
scripts polled every 0.25s when they should poll every 0.5s** — twice the VM
load, forever, because of a word in a comment. `DLCOrreryConsoleScript`,
`DLC06FletcherScript` and `ND02BattleControlSCRIPT` are among them.

Replaced by `script_convert/facts.py`, which derives all six from the parse
tree. Semantic diff 475 -> 515: 40 scripts whose interval is now correct.

---

## 21. `Set X to <literal>` dropped when the block filter was unconvertible — FIXED
<a id="21-set-x-literal-dropped"></a>

168 Nehrim scripts (`EP0001Kuecken` et al.) lost `Set EPWert to 15`. `EPWert`
is the argument to the OBSE XP-award call in `OnDeath`, so every affected
creature awarded **0 XP**.

Cause: a `begin OnHitWith <weapon>` filter was judged unconvertible whenever
the body had already bound the weapon as a property under its own narrow type
(`Weapon`), and the whole body was then emitted commented out. A base record
compares to a `Form` event parameter perfectly well. `_block_filter_guard` now
accepts `existing in _BASE_OBJECT_PAPYRUS` against a `Form` parameter.

Same cause, same fix: `TES4_CGRopeBucketScript` — shooting the CharacterGen
rope bucket with an iron arrow advances MQ01 to stage 58, and the body was
disabled — plus 8 more Nehrim scripts (`MQ06Golem01Script`: `RemoveSpell`,
two `EffectShader.Stop`, a `Say`). Nehrim went from 8 unconvertible filters
to 0; Oblivion's remaining 8 are genuine (no parameter carries the filtered
object).

---

## 22. `If True` where one `&&` term had no equivalent — FIXED
<a id="22-if-true-where-one"></a>

4 Nehrim spell scripts (`SpellEinfrieren10Prozent`) collapsed
`Target.isActor == 0 || Target.IsDead() || Target.IsOnMount()` to `If True`,
so the freeze fired on **every** target. `_logical` now keeps the convertible
terms and comments only the dead one.

---

## 23. Sentence spacing stripped from message text — FIXED
<a id="23-sentence-spacing-stripped-from"></a>

76 Oblivion scripts ran two sentences together in a `MessageBox`: the Arena
poster read `...valor and skill.Anyone can gamble...`. The authored SCTX has
the space; it was lost on the way out.

---

## 24. `setDestroyed 0` and `setDestroyed 1` both destroyed — FIXED
<a id="24-setdestroyed-0-setdestroyed-1"></a>

`SEObeliskNewSCRIPT`'s deferred-destroy rewrite dropped the boolean, so
`_deferred_destroy` turned BOTH directions into
`DestroyAfterAnimation(...)` — the "safety net for destroyed status" flipped
nothing. Only `... , true` defers now.

---

## 25. Three converter regressions in the parse-tree rewrite — FIXED
<a id="25-three-converter-regressions-parse"></a>

Found by diffing generated output against master head, not by compiling.

**An empty `OnActivate` was dropped.** In TES4 the PRESENCE of the block
consumes the activation, so an empty body is meaningful. Dropping it lost both
the consume and the door-relock preamble (`ND04TitanSCRIPT`,
`ARLesserWelkyndStoneStaticScript`). `events()` now keeps a block that
`_consumes_activation` reports, body or not.

**`TES4Polyfill.EnterOblivionGate` was never emitted.** The gate's identity is
known only on the authored line that discards it (`set MQ00.nearOblivionGate
to 0`), so the capture must precede the body. Re-added as
`assemble.gate_capture`; without it `CloseCurrentOblivionGate` had nowhere to
send the player back to.

**`ModPCSkill`/`AdvancePCSkill` emitted `(Self as Actor).ModActorValue(...)`**
— `None` on the Quest scripts that call it, so 12 scripts' skill gains did
nothing (`DAOghmaInfiniumScript` has 9). Both are player commands by
definition and now route to `Game.GetPlayer()`. `Game.AdvanceSkill` is NOT the
right target: per the CK wiki it adds skill-USAGE progress and "won't
necessarily change the Skill itself", where `ModPCSkill Blade 10` raises the
skill by 10.

**`TES4Polyfill.RestoreFallDamage` was never emitted** — `SuppressFallDamage`
writes a GLOBAL GMST, so leaving it set disables fall damage permanently. The
flag had no setter after the rewrite; now derived in `_load_facts` from the
tree, and the restore MERGES into the script's existing `OnEffectFinish`
rather than declaring a second one.



## The command table: what a row is, and what it is not
<a id="command-rows"></a>

`command_rows.py` holds one `Cmd` row per TES4 command whose whole conversion is
"resolve a receiver, convert a couple of arguments, register a property type,
emit one expression". Each row replaced a name-guarded branch in
`_emit_function`. Anything needing real logic stays a handler in `commands.py`;
`HANDLED_COMMANDS` names those so the parser still reads them AS commands, and
`KNOWN_COMMANDS` is the union.

**Every derived set is a PROJECTION of `COMMAND_ROWS`, so it is derived below
the table and never above it.** `_flagged()` builds `_ACTOR_ONLY_FUNCTIONS`,
`_BOOL_VALUED_FUNCTIONS` and the rest by scanning row flags. Deriving one before
the FNV rows merged in froze them out of `KNOWN_COMMANDS`, and `cross_ref.py`'s
pre-pass reads `_ACTOR_ONLY_FUNCTIONS` to type ref-vars BEFORE emission — so a
row missing from the table is a missing CAST at the call site, not just a
missing conversion. Removing the `kill` row cost three Oblivion scripts their
compile that way (`ObjectReference cannot be assigned to Actor`).

Three flags carry type information the emitters cannot recover from the
template: `actor_only` (promote the subject to `Actor`), `objref_shared` (do
NOT — the method is declared on `ObjectReference`, and `(Self as Actor)` on a
STAT or DOOR yields `None`), and `bool_valued` (the `X == 1` / `X == 0` idiom
collapses to `X` / `!X`).

### Papyrus VALUE types, and why a global is one
<a id="papyrus-value-types"></a>

`_PAPYRUS_VALUE_TYPES` names the types that hold a VALUE. Everything else is an
object type, which cannot be assigned an integer — TES4 wrote `set myRef to 0`
to clear a reference, and that has to become `None`. `GlobalVariable` is listed
even though it IS an object, because a TES4 write to a global is a write to its
VALUE (`GlobalVariable.SetValue(0)`), so its integer must survive.

### Command families matched by PREFIX
<a id="command-prefix-families"></a>

`COMMAND_PREFIXES` matches a family by prefix rather than whole name, longest
prefix first so a specific family can override a broader one. The Elys music
family additionally requires a longer name: `emcount` is a local VARIABLE in
some scripts rather than a command, and a bare `emc` prefix would swallow it.

## A neutralised command must be inert IN POSITION
<a id="neutralised-command-inert-in-position"></a>

A command with no Skyrim equivalent emits an inert value plus a `;NE:` note.
**Which inert value depends on where the command is written**, and getting it
wrong is not cosmetic:

- **Operand position** (inside a larger condition or arithmetic) takes a BARE
  literal. A trailing `;` comment swallows the rest of the expression —
  `If True  ;(False ;NE: ...)` silently drops the other terms. `isKeyPressed`,
  `getControl`, `getObjectType`, `GetGameRestarted` and the OBSE form-type
  tests are all read this way.
- **Statement position** takes the note AS the whole line. `SkipAnim` and
  `SetNumericIniSetting` are written on their own line (Nehrim's portcullis
  calls `<ref>.SkipAnim`), so the comment IS the emission.
- **Never an undefined identifier.** An unrouted name fails the CHECKER, which
  emits no `.pex` for the owning script and takes every dependent down with it
  ([why](#compile-failure-takes-dependents-down)). This is what kept
  `mwMorroDefaultQuestScript` from running, and with it the `PlayerInMorrowind`
  global gating Fargoth's greeting.

**Polarity is a decision, not a default.** `FileExists` answers PRESENT: every
caller uses it as an installation check against Oblivion-side artifacts that do
not exist after conversion BY DESIGN, so answering 0 fired every "missing file"
branch and greeted the player with a bogus installation-error box on load.
`GetModIndex` lands on the not-an-error side of the `> 1` mis-order test for the
same reason.

`AddActorValues` (an OBSE plugin) is the clean case: every caller already guards
the block with `IsPluginInstalled "AddActorValues" == 0 / return`, so the body
is dead by construction and only needed to stop failing the checker.

Some neutralised names are reachable through SKSE
(`docs/audits/skse_conversion.md`); nothing here targets SKSE today, so this is
the current behaviour rather than a judgement that SKSE is off the table.

## Zero-argument reads need a `FUNCTION_MAP` entry to be seen at all
<a id="zero-arg-reads-need-function-map"></a>

A command taking no arguments is always written bare, and the dotted member path
(`NextActor.IsCreature`) resolves a name as a FUNCTION only when it is a
`FUNCTION_MAP` key. Without an entry the read falls through to raw member access
on a type with no such property — `field or property not found`, fatal to the
whole file. This is why both spellings of a command are listed even when they
convert identically: `IsCreature`/`GetIsCreature`, `GetIsGhost`/`GetUnconscious`
(only the SETTERS had been mapped), `GetTalkedToPC`/`GetTalkedToPCP`,
`GetPlayerHasLastRiddenHorse`/`IsPlayersLastRiddenHorse` (one engine function,
`0x1153`, under two authored spellings).

See also [routing zero-argument commands](#zero-argument-commands-must-be).

## Receiver and argument are not interchangeable
<a id="receiver-and-argument-not-interchangeable"></a>

Several TES4 commands name their subject on the opposite side from the Papyrus
call, so a positional mapping asks the mirror-image question and compiles
cleanly while being wrong.

- **`GetDetected` is the OBSERVER's question; `IsDetectedBy` is the TARGET's**,
  so receiver and argument SWAP. `CharGenQuest`'s `GlenroyRef.getdetected
  player` ("has Glenroy spotted the player", which advances the Ambush-B stage)
  became "has the player spotted Glenroy" — true the moment the player looks
  down the corridor.
- **`GetDetectionLevel`** has the same shape (UESP opcode `0x10B4`) and the same
  swap, plus a RESCALE: TES4 levels run 0..3 but `IsDetectedBy` is a Bool, and
  all 56 call sites read `>= 2`, `>= 3` or `== 3`. Scaling to TES4's top level
  yields 0 or 3, satisfying every threshold exactly when detected; a bare
  `Bool >= 2` is rejected by the CK compiler
  ([why](#bool-cannot-carry-multivalued-threshold)).
- **`IsActorDetected` takes NO argument** (UESP opcode `0x10B5`) — "am I
  detected by ANYONE", which Skyrim has no primitive for. Mapped to
  `IsDetectedBy` the bare form defaulted to the player and emitted
  `Game.GetPlayer().IsDetectedBy(Game.GetPlayer())`, always true.
- **`UncompleteQuest <Quest>`** names the quest as an ARGUMENT; Papyrus spells
  `Reset()` as a method ON the quest, so the argument becomes the receiver.
  Mapped straight it emitted `Reset(fbmwEBBone)` — "function takes 0 parameters
  not 1".
- **`ref.Update3D`** is written as a receiver method, so the polyfill must
  CONSUME the receiver as its argument; `ActorRef.TES4Polyfill.Update3D()` is
  not Papyrus. With no receiver the subject is the player. Papyrus has no direct
  call (`QueueNiNodeUpdate` is SKSE), but the engine's own refresh idiom is a
  disable/enable cycle, which rebuilds exactly the same 3D.
- **`StopCombatAlarmOnActor`** stops all combat and alarms AGAINST this actor —
  the opposite direction from `StopCombat`, which ends the actor's OWN
  aggression. Skyrim has the exact native, `Actor.StopCombatAlarm()`.
  `player.SCAOnActor` is the idiom for calming a mob attacking the player
  (`Dark19Whispers` holds the player still through the Night Mother's speech);
  with `StopCombat` everyone stayed hostile.
- **`IsOwner`** asks whether the ACTOR owns this reference and is written bare
  to mean the player. `IsInFaction` was a different question, and the bare form
  emitted the argument-less `IsInFaction()` — a hard compile error.
  `GetActorOwner()` answers it.

## An argument that looks ignorable usually is not
<a id="argument-that-looks-ignorable"></a>

- **`SetDoorDefaultOpen <flag>`** takes a BOOLEAN, not a flag to drop: per
  UESP (opcode `0x10D8`) "a value of 1 will make the door open by default", so 0
  CLOSES it. Hardcoding `SetOpen(true)` inverted the `0` form — MQ16's endgame
  `ICPalaceElderCouncilMainDoor.SetDoorDefaultOpen 0`, whose own authored
  comment reads "close Elder Council door", flung it open instead.
- **`ToggleFirstPerson <0|1>`** is one command with an argument in Oblivion and
  two argument-free globals in Skyrim, so the argument picks which. The bare
  form is a true toggle, which Papyrus cannot express (it cannot READ the
  camera mode — `GetCameraState` is SKSE), so it takes the third-person branch,
  the mode every caller is refreshing in. Skyrim's own model-swap script for
  the same job, `DLC1PlayerVampireChangeScript`, calls `ForceThirdPerson()`
  unconditionally rather than testing.
- **`SetCanFastTravelFromWorld <worldspace> <flag>`** toggles per worldspace;
  Skyrim's `Game.EnableFastTravel(bool)` is GLOBAL, so the worldspace operand is
  dropped and the widened scope noted. The arity difference is why this needs a
  handler — a straight map passed the worldspace where the bool goes.
- **`SetCurrentHealth <value>`** (OBSE) takes only the value; the actor value is
  implicit in the name. Mapped onto `SetActorValue` it swallowed the number as
  the AV NAME and set nothing.
- **The OBSE `...NS` / `...Silent` / `...2` spellings** differ from the vanilla
  command only in suppressing the pickup sound and the "item added" message, or
  in widening argument types. Papyrus carries `abSilent` on the SAME natives, so
  these are the same command, not a missing feature.
- **`PlaySound`** is written QUOTED as often as bare, and the property must be
  registered under the name actually EMITTED. Registering the raw argument kept
  the quotes and `_safe_property_name` turned each into an underscore, declaring
  a second, never-bindable `Sound Property _X_` beside the real one — 75 dead
  properties across 23 files.
- **`Autosave`** takes a save-slot NAME, which Papyrus does not accept, so it
  is dropped and the engine picks the slot.
- <a id="console-saves-are-dropped"></a>**`con_Save` / `con_SaveGame` /
  `SaveGame` are dropped entirely (2026-09-25).** Across
  every export there are 8 calls, in 2 scripts. Seven of those calls are in Nehrim's
  `AutoSaveQuestScript`, a save manager: at startup it turns off Oblivion's own
  save on wait/travel/rest and the `Autosave` command. It then saves every
  2 minutes and on every cell change, rotating through seven named slots. The
  eighth is Morroblivion's `fbmwBMWerewolfPC`, which saves once per night the
  player turns into a werewolf. `Game.RequestSave()` writes a NEW save file
  every call, so the conversion piled up a new save file every few minutes.
  Skyrim's own autosaves (load doors, rest/wait/travel, the player's
  settings) do the job these scripts did for Oblivion. The story checkpoints
  all use `Autosave` (45 calls), which stays `Game.RequestAutoSave()`.

### FO3/FNV commands that reach the compiler unrouted
<a id="fnv-unrouted-commands"></a>

FO3/FNV name commands Oblivion never had, and an unrouted name reaches the
compiler as an undefined identifier — which fails the CHECKER, so no `.pex` is
written for the owning script
([why that cascades](#compile-failure-takes-dependents-down)). They live in
`constants_falloutnv.py`, which merges into `COMMAND_ROWS` before every derived
set is projected from it.

Routed to a real native, verified against the vanilla headers:

| FO3/FNV | Papyrus | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `ShowMessage <MESG> [args]` | `Message.Show(afArg1..afArg9)` | takes exactly the substitution values FNV passes (807 sites, max 2) |
| `AddToFaction <fac> <rank>` | `Actor.SetFactionRank(Faction, int)` | "Adds the actor to the faction if necessary", so one native covers both |
| `RemoveFromFaction <fac>` | `Actor.RemoveFromFaction(Faction)` | |
| `GetFactionRelation <actor>` | `Actor.GetFactionReaction(Actor)` | returns 0=Neutral 1=Enemy 2=Ally 3=Friend, the enum FNV's own source comments document |
| `GetHealthPercentage` | `Actor.GetActorValuePercentage("Health")` | 0.0-1.0, matching the authored `< 0.5` tests |
| `GetDestructionStage` | `ObjectReference.GetCurrentDestructionStage()` | the honest native; returns 0 because this conversion writes no DEST |
| `GetMapMarkerVisible` | `ObjectReference.IsMapMarkerVisible()` | `bare_bool cmp_bool`, so `== 0` collapses to `!(...)` rather than comparing Bool to Int |
| `CIOS <spell>` / `CastImmediateOnSelf` | `Spell.Cast(self, self)` | the shared `cast` handler under FNV's names (`FALLOUT_COMMAND_ALIASES`; 49 SCPT + 28 INFO sites) |

Neutralised — no equivalent exists: `GetFurnitureMarkerID`, `GetHitLocation`,
`IsHardcore`, `GetWeaponHealthPerc`, `GetActorFactionPlayerEnemy`,
`GetAnimAction`, `GetIgnoreCrime`, `IsGoreDisabled`, `GetXPForNextLevel`.
`IsWin32` answers **1**: it guards a platform branch, and the Windows build is
the one that exists.

**A row whose emit reads arguments must match how the command is WRITTEN.**
`getfactionrelation` was first written `{p0}.GetReaction({p1})`, reading
arguments 0 and 1 — but all 3 authored sites name the actor as the RECEIVER
(`VFSGloriaRef.GetFactionRelation player`), so `{p0}` took `player` and `{p1}`
found nothing, emitting `player.GetReaction(var_)` plus a bogus
`Faction Property player`.

### An unmapped AV command silently became a READ
<a id="unmapped-av-command-became-a-read"></a>

`commands.py`'s AV handler is registered for every `av`-flagged command and
picked its Papyrus name with `_AV_PAPYRUS.get(call.name, 'GetActorValue')`.
That default is a trap: a command absent from the table converted into a
**read** whatever it meant. FO3/FNV's `RestoreAV`/`DamageAV` (18 + 37 + 49 + 6
authored sites, and **zero** in Oblivion, Nehrim or Morroblivion) fell through
it, so `Player.RestoreAV perceptioncondition 100` — a heal — emitted
`GetActorValue("perceptioncondition", 100)`, which is both the wrong operation
and a two-argument call to a one-argument native.

The fallback is now the ROW's own `emit`, with `_AV_PAPYRUS` kept as the
override for the two commands whose row cannot say it (`advancepcskill` has no
emit; `modpcskill` deliberately differs — `Game.AdvanceSkill` adds skill USAGE,
not the skill itself). Every other entry already agreed with its row, so no
TES4 call site moves. `Actor.psc` declares both natives with exactly the TES4
argument shape: `RestoreActorValue(string, float)`, `DamageActorValue(string,
float)`.

### <a id="fallout-actor-value-names"></a>FO3/FNV actor-value names

**Code:** `constants_falloutnv.py` `FALLOUT_ATTRIBUTES`, `FALLOUT_ACTOR_VALUE_MAP`,
`FALLOUT_UNMAPPED_ACTOR_VALUES`; merged in `constants.py` (`PRIMARY_STATS`,
`AV_ARGUMENT_NAMES`); applied in `commands.py` `actor_value`.

Scripts name actor values by string, so the AV argument went through
Oblivion's `ACTOR_VALUE_MAP` and any name missing from it was emitted
unchanged. Most of Fallout's are missing, and Skyrim's name table
(`CreationKit.exe`, the strings from `Aggression` to `ReflectDamage`) lacks
them, so each read returned 0 and each write was rejected
([above](#skyrim-has-no-attributes)). Fallout's script names come from each
GECK's own table (`Geck.exe`, from `Aggression` to `DamageThreshold`); FO3 has
`SmallGuns` where New Vegas has `Guns` and `Survival`. Counted over the
exports' `SCPT` text and the result scripts in `INFO`, `QUST`, `PACK`, `TERM`,
`PERK` and `NOTE`, 144 of Fallout 3's 1,008 actor-value calls and 227 of New
Vegas's 1,062 named a value Skyrim lacks.

| Fallout name | Before | Now |
|---|---|---|
| Repair, Speech, Barter, Lockpick | unknown name, read 0 | `Smithing`, `Speechcraft`, `Speechcraft`, `Lockpicking`, as the condition side maps them ([conditions](tes5_import_conditions.md#fallout-actor-values)) |
| Perception, Charisma | unknown name, read 0 | `100.0`, write dropped, like the five S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats that share a name with an Oblivion attribute |
| Karma, XP, Medicine, Science, Explosives, the weapon skills, Survival, Unarmed, RadiationRads, ActionPoints, BloodyMess, RadResist, EnergyResist, EmpResist, Turbo, DamageThreshold, the hardcore needs | unknown name, read 0 | inert read (`note`), write dropped |

An inert read folds a comparison to `false`, or drops out of its `&&`/`||`
chain ([comparing an inert operand](#comparing-an-inert-operand)), so neither
direction of a skill or karma check is decided by a 0 nobody authored. The
conditions drop the same values, which passes them; a script cannot pass a
check it no longer evaluates, so it drops the term instead.

The renames apply to the actor-value argument only, never to a bare name:
`lockpick` is also Fallout's bobby-pin item, and `GetItemCount lockpick` must
keep it.

Names Skyrim has pass through unchanged, including some the conditions drop:
the limb conditions (`PerceptionCondition` … `BrainCondition`), whose writes
(`RestoreAV` after healing) a script reads back itself; `HealRate` and
`DamageResist`, whose scale differs ([conditions](tes5_import_conditions.md#fallout-actor-values));
and `Variable01`-`Variable10`, which scripts use as their own flags.

Converted with `convert_standalone` over every `SCPT` in the exports, before
and after: Oblivion 0 of 2,393 scripts changed, Fallout 3 65 of 1,257, New
Vegas 84 of 2,576, every changed line an actor-value call or a property left
unused by a dropped write.

### <a id="negative-comparand"></a>A negative comparand is still a number

**Code:** `emit/expr.py` `_numeric_cmp`, `_is_number`.

`-250` parses as unary minus over the literal `250`, so `_numeric_cmp` did not
recognize it as a number and the comparison took the plain path: an inert
read compared against it stayed as `0 >= -250`, a decided answer, where
against `250` it folds or drops out. Karma checks are where it shows
(`AchievementScript` tests `>= -250` and `< -250`). A negated literal now
takes the same path as any other number. No Oblivion script changed, since
`_bool_literal_cmp` emits a non-inert comparison exactly as the plain path
does.

### A digit-leading member name swallowed its dot
<a id="digit-leading-member-names"></a>

FO3/FNV declare variables whose names start with a digit — `int 1stFloorDetect`
in `RepconHQFreeform` — which the declaration path already renames through
`_safe_property_name` (`d1stFloorDetect`). A REMOTE access did not survive the
LEXER: `.` starts a number when a digit follows, so `RepconHQFreeform.1stFloor
Detect` lexed as one IDENT `.1stFloorDetect` with the dot inside the name. The
parser never saw a member access, so the whole `set <quest>.<var> to <n>`
statement passed through as raw TES4 text and the compiler rejected it —
"(block statement) invalid token: ." on 38 FNV sites.

The dot is emitted as its own OP when a digit-leading identifier follows it.
TES4 is unaffected: a digit-leading name there is always an EditorID in
argument position (`1TrapFireMineWorldRef`), never a member, and those still
lex as one token because no `.` precedes them.

### `Kill` takes only the killer
<a id="kill-takes-only-the-killer"></a>

`Actor.psc` declares `Function Kill(Actor akKiller = None) native` — one
optional argument. TES4 matches it (measured: Oblivion 115 bare calls and 6 with
a killer, Nehrim 97/9, Morroblivion 6 bare — never more), but FO3/FNV's `Kill
killer dismember caused-by-explosion` adds two flags Papyrus has no target for:
48 FNV sites pass 2 or 3 arguments and failed the checker with "function takes 1
parameters not 2".

The row therefore renders `{ref}.Kill({a0})` rather than mapping the argument
list through, which is identical to the old output for every TES4 call and drops
only the flags that cannot be expressed. It keeps `actor_only`: that flag is
what `cross_ref.py` reads to type a ref-var before emission, and removing it
cost three Oblivion scripts their compile (`ObjectReference cannot be assigned
to Actor`).

### `Self` compared against a SCRIPT-typed reference
<a id="self-compared-to-a-script-typed-ref"></a>

A property naming a placed reference whose base carries a script is typed as
that SCRIPT (`_add_scro_ref` prefers it so cross-script variable reads work).
`Self` is likewise the script's own class, so an identity test between two such
references compares two unrelated classes:

```
If Self == vHVLevel02MainDoorREF || Self == vHVLevel01DownstairsDoorREF
you can't compare type `TES4_NVEcvDoorBG01SCRIPT` with type `TES4_HVLevel1To2DoorScript`
```

`_self_cast` already handled `Self == <Actor>` and `Self == <script>.member`;
the bare script-typed property fell through. It casts the OTHER side to
`ObjectReference` — the type both really are — rather than casting `Self` to
Actor, because a door is not an actor and the comparison only asks whether the
two references are the same object.

🛑 **Guard the arm on `_self_reference(extends) == 'Self'`.** In an
ActiveMagicEffect, TopicInfo or PlayerAlias script, TES4's `Self` is NOT the
script's own object — it redirects to `GetTargetActor()`, `akSpeakerRef` or
`GetReference()`. Without the guard, `MS40PotionEffect`'s
`if (GetSelf == RonaHassildorRef)` emitted
`(Self as ObjectReference) == (RonaHassildorRef as ObjectReference)`, comparing
the MAGIC EFFECT against an NPC instead of the effect's target — a test that can
never be true. Caught by the semantic diff as `calls[gettargetactor/0]: 3 -> 2`.

### `SetFactionRank <faction> -1` is REMOVAL, not a rank
<a id="setfactionrank--1-is-removal"></a>

**Code:** `script_convert/commands.py:set_faction_rank`,
`script_convert/static_scripts/TES4Polyfill.psc:SetFactionRank`

TES4 spells "leave this faction" as `SetFactionRank <faction> -1`. Papyrus's
`Actor.SetFactionRank` does the opposite: the CK wiki says it "adds the actor to
the faction if necessary", and a negative rank is one it RETAINS — vanilla parks
Lydia in `PotentialMarriageFaction` at rank -1 while every other member sits at
0. So the 1:1 mapping JOINED the faction the script meant to leave. Removal in
Skyrim is `RemoveFromFaction`.

Census of every `SetFactionRank`/`ModFactionRank` call in the exported corpus
(`SCPT`/`QUST`/`INFO`/`PACK` script text, all plugins):

| Rank argument | Calls |
|---|---:|
| `0` | 374 |
| **`-1`** | **271** |
| `1`-`10` | 387 |
| `NehrimSymbolVar` (non-literal) | 1 |

So 271 of 1033 calls (26%) were inverted. The user-visible symptom was
vampirism: the CURE scripts are what enrolled the player, since
`MS40PotionEffect` ends with `player.setfactionrank playervampirefaction -1`
and Morroblivion's `fbmwVAVampCureQuest` cure stage does the same for
`0clanSaundae`/`0clanSberne`/`0clanSquarra`. Faction membership is global
state every NPC's conditions read, which is why *every* NPC — including Tamriel
Rebuilt's Morrowind NPCs, reading vampire-clan membership — treated a
non-vampire player as a vampire at once. The rest of the 271 are ordinary
faction departures (`BleakersWayFaction`, `MQ15PrisonerFaction`,
`claudemaricthugfaction` — the UESP mod-fix for *Nothing You Can Possess* uses
the `-1` idiom explicitly to stop S'razirr fighting the player).

A LITERAL negative emits `RemoveFromFaction` directly; the one variable rank
routes through the polyfill, which branches on the sign at runtime.
`ModFactionRank` is NOT affected — it is relative, and Papyrus's
`ModFactionRank` has the same meaning.

### `GetFactionRelation` has TWO receiver kinds
<a id="getfactionrelation-has-two-receivers"></a>

**Code:** `script_convert/commands_falloutnv.py`

FNV writes `<x>.GetFactionRelation <actor>` against two different receivers.
Censused over all 9 authored sites (FNV-only; Oblivion, Nehrim and Morroblivion
have none):

| Receiver | Sites | Papyrus |
|---|---:|---|
| ACHR (a placed actor) | 8 | `Actor.GetFactionReaction(Actor)` — exact |
| FACT (a faction) | 1 | none |

`Faction.psc` offers only `int Function GetReaction(Faction akOther)`, which
takes a FACTION, so the faction-toward-actor question has no reader. The
handler declines for an actor receiver — letting the row emit the real native —
and neutralises only the faction one.

⚠️ The row alone got this wrong in both directions earlier: first reading the
ARGUMENT as the receiver (emitting `player.GetReaction(var_)` plus a bogus
`Faction Property player`), then typing the FACT receiver as an Actor.

### A TRUNCATED script name breaks cross-script member types
<a id="truncated-script-names"></a>

Papyrus caps a ScriptName at 38 characters, so `papyrus_script_name` truncates a
long EditorID and appends a 4-hex hash — `VHDLegionPowerPlant01BattleControllerScript`
becomes `TES4_VHDLegionPowerPlant01BattleC_AD35`.

`remote_type_of` stripped the `TES4_` prefix and looked the stem up in
`script_all_vars`, which is keyed by the AUTHORED EditorID. For a truncated name
that lookup always misses, so the member's type came back `''` and
`_typed_assign` skipped the coercion it exists to apply:

```
Replacement = VHDLegionPP01BCREF.CurrentBackup
value with type `ObjectReference` cannot be assigned to a variable with type `Actor`
```

The transform is the single source of truth, so re-applying it to each known
script EditorID identifies the original. The mapping is built once and cached —
it is a hot path.

🛑 **Build it from ORIGINAL-CASE EditorIDs.** The suffix is an MD5 of the whole
prefixed name, so it is case-sensitive:

| Input | `papyrus_script_name` |
|---|---|
| `VHDLegionPowerPlant01BattleControllerScript` | `TES4_VHDLegionPowerPlant01BattleC_AD35` |
| `vhdlegionpowerplant01battlecontrollerscript` | `TES4_vhdlegionpowerplant01battlec_B88E` |

`script_all_vars` is keyed lowercase, so a map built from ITS keys computes the
wrong hash and never matches. `script_formid_to_edid` carries the authored
spelling and is the right source.

### A cross-script READ was never checked for danglingness
<a id="dangling-cross-script-read"></a>

`_dangling_cross_script_target` already comments out a WRITE to `Owner.Var` when
the owner resolves to a script whose variable table is known and lacks the name.
The matching READ in `emit_member` had no such check — its last branch ("not a
command anywhere, so a cross-script variable read") emitted the property access
unconditionally, and the compiler rejected the script:

```
field or property `behemoth` not found      If (Game.GetPlayer().behemoth == 1)
field or property `HasBeenEaten` not found  If ... && FortCaesarRef.HasBeenEaten
```

Censused over `export/FalloutNV.esm/SCPT.txt`, `behemoth` and `HasBeenEaten` are
declared by **no script at all** — dangling in Bethesda's own data. `Follower1`
and `CurrentBackup` ARE declared, but by a different script than the ref
resolves to (`GomorrahCasinoEnterTriggerREF` carries
`GomorrahCasinoEnterTriggerScript`, which has no `Follower1`), which is the same
defect seen from the other side.

The read now takes the note the write already took. The DETECTOR is unchanged:
it still fires only when the owner resolves to a script whose variable list is
known and lacks the name.

🛑 **Do not widen it to "the record resolved but carries no SCRI".** That looks
like it should catch `player.behemoth`, and it does — but a placed reference
carries its script on the BASE OBJECT, not the REFR, so `record_scri` misses it
and the rule condemns perfectly good cross-script access. Measured: the
widening changed **480 Oblivion scripts**, dropping writes such as
`DAClavicusDogStatueREF.dogtalk1` and `HorsePCWhiteAnvilREF.respawnhorse`, and
it hit the play-tested `TES4_CharGenQuest`. Reverted; the four FNV names are
left to their own row entries instead.

### Five zero-argument commands were listed but never ROUTED
<a id="listed-but-unrouted-commands"></a>

`ZERO_ARG_REF_FUNCTIONS` named `getalarmed`, `getdisease`, `getwantblocking`,
`ismoving` and `isturning`, but none had a row in `COMMAND_ROWS` — so nothing
ever emitted them and `Ref.GetAlarmed` fell through `emit_member` to a property
read that does not exist.

The CK wiki's own "Papyrus Version" section names `IsAlarmed - Actor` as
GetAlarmed's equivalent, so that one converts properly; the other four have no
Papyrus section at all and become inert reads. With rows in place the literal
set collapses to `isactor`, the rest arriving through `_flagged('zero_arg')`.

Authored use: `getalarmed` 1 (FNV), `getfriendhit` 2 (Nehrim) + 2 (FNV),
`getcontainerinventorycount` 3 (FNV); the other four are unused in all four
plugins. `GetContainerInventoryCount` maps to `ObjectReference.GetNumItems()`
(`Int Function GetNumItems() Native`), an exact equivalent.

## The stage-arrival latch
<a id="stage-arrival-latch"></a>

**Code:** `script_convert/stage_latch.py`

🛑 A `GetStage()==N && <timer> <= 0` guard waits on a timer that **stage N's own
fragment charges**, and nothing makes that charge land before the guard is first
tested. At or below zero is the timer's NORMAL resting state — it also goes
negative whenever a line is dropped — so the instant stage N arrives the guard
is ALREADY satisfied and the body runs before stage N's fragment has spoken.

Measured (`temp/chargen_rec_4.log`, 14:47:14–18): CharacterGen sat at
`convTimer = -0.076` for four seconds after Renault's line was dropped, so
`GetStage()==16 && convTimer<=0` fired the moment stage 16 was set. `SetStage(17)`
ran, the force-greet pulled the player into the menu, and the Emperor's stage-16
line was never spoken — INFO `00032B11` ("You ... I've seen you") is gated on
`GetStage CharacterGen == 16` and is the ONLY CharGenVoice entry for that stage,
so once the stage reads 17 nothing qualifies at all.

The fix is a latch: remember which stage the quest was on last pass, and require
one full poll pass at stage N before honouring the guard — that pass is what lets
stage N's fragment run and charge the timer. 25 guards of this shape exist in the
Oblivion build; the CharacterGen ones are simply the ones that show.

The latch is keyed CASE-INSENSITIVELY. One TES4 file spells the same quest both
ways (CharacterGen's poll uses `characterGen` on some lines and `CharacterGen` on
others); keying on the raw spelling emitted TWO latches, and a guard could then
compare against the one the poll tail never updates — so it would never open.
Papyrus is case-insensitive, so the duplicate declarations compiled and the fault
would only have shown in game.

### The dialogue poll gate
<a id="the-dialogue-poll-gate"></a>

**Code:** `script_convert/assemble.py:_dialogue_gate`

TES4 `GameMode` never ran while a dialogue menu was open. Measured in game
(CharacterGen 40-50) with no gate: the Emperor's poll fired during his stage-42
dialogue and its `Say()` INTERRUPTED his 17.8 s Goodbye reply, so the reply's
`setstage 43` was lost and the birthsign menu never opened; the quest poll's
stage-45 guard fired during the stage-44 dialogue and sent Baurus in to
force-greet over it.

**Only scripts that SPEAK carry the gate** (`conv.sc.uses_say`). Applying it to
every poll -- the first attempt, same day -- put `PlayerIsInDialogue` on ~210
quest polls at 0.1 s and the VM starved: End fragments ran 11-17 s late and
"Yessir" played twice. A poll that never speaks cannot cut a line, so it does
not need the gate.

### A worldspace property must use the CONVERTED EditorID
<a id="worldspace-property-rename"></a>

The importer renames Oblivion's `Tamriel` worldspace to `TES4Tamriel`
(`tes5_import/record_types/world.py`, `convert_WRLD`): its FormID 0x3C remaps to
0x0100003C, which would otherwise override Skyrim's own Tamriel.

Arktwend is a Morrowind-engine game, so the TES3 exporter gives it the same
synthesized `WrldMorrowind` as Morrowind itself; when Arktwend (or a master of
it) is in the plugin chain, the importer writes `WrldArktwend` instead so the two
never share an EditorID. Its persistent cell (`<worldspace>Persistent`) follows,
and its display name becomes "Arktwend" in place of the exporter's hardcoded
"Morrowind" (which also names its Location, `TES4ArktwendLocation`). Morrowind,
both modes, keeps `WrldMorrowind`.

Every rename lives in ONE table, `core/worldspace_names.py`. An import run sets
the chain (`set_worldspace_plugins`) from the plugin and its export's masters;
`CrossRefGraph` carries its own copy (`worldspace_renames`) because script
conversion ships the graph to pool workers, where a module global would reset.
The shipped-LOD lookup in `terrain_lod.shipped_lod_worldspaces` still has its
own Tamriel-only copy.

A `GetInCell` family whose members include EXTERIOR cells compares them by
worldspace plus grid square, because a Papyrus `Cell` property cannot bind to an
exterior (see `split_cell_family`). That emits a `WorldSpace` property named
after the TES4 worldspace -- and for Tamriel the TES4 name is the one the output
does NOT use, so the property binds to nothing and reads `None`. Every
`TES4_ws == Tamriel` arm is then false forever, and the helper returns false for
any exterior position.

Measured on Oblivion.esm: `Tamriel` was the 4th most common unbound declared
property, in 51 scripts (`tools/validate/vmad_property_typecheck.py --unbound`).

MQ04 is the case that shows the cost. Its poll bails the Cloud Ruler scene out
to the waiting stage when the player is not in the temple family:

```
if (getstage MQ04 >=35 && getstage MQ04 <= 41)
  if player.getincell CloudRulerTemple == 0
    setstage MQ04 45
```

Fast travel lands the player OUTSIDE the gates, in exterior cell
`CloudRulerTempleExterior02` (grid 3,39) -- inside the prefix family, so vanilla
does not bail. With the worldspace property unbound the exterior arms cannot
match, the helper returns false, and stage 35 -> 45 fires on the arrival pass,
skipping the gate speech, the Blades hail and Martin's speech.

`converted_worldspace_edid()` in `script_convert/constants.py` is the single
spelling of the rename; `asset_convert/lod/terrain_lod.py` needs the same
mapping to find LOD worldspaces in the converted ESM.

### A bare ref command on a receiver parses as a MEMBER
<a id="a-bare-ref-command-parses-as-member"></a>

TES4 writes a zero-argument command without parentheses, so `rSelf.GetLinkedRef`
reaches the tree as a `Member` (owner `rSelf`, name `GetLinkedRef`) rather than
a `Call`. `is_ref_typed` answered the Call spelling from `_REF_RETURNING` but
sent the Member spelling to the remote-variable lookup, which of course has no
entry for a COMMAND name — so the null test never fired and
`rSelf.GetLinkedRef != 0` emitted literally:

```
you can't compare type `ObjectReference` with type `Int`
```

The Member arm now checks `_REF_RETURNING` first. Both spellings mean the same
read; only the punctuation differs.

The rest of that arm is unchanged, and both its lookups are still required:
`remote_type_of` resolves through the owner's declared `TES4_<script>` property
type, while a quest named bare (`SE09.rebuiltGatekeeperRef`) has no such
property and is reached by `_is_ref_typed_access` via EditorID → SCRI.

### Code after a `Return` fails the whole script
<a id="unreachable-after-return"></a>

TES4 accepted unreachable code and simply never ran it. Bethesda shipped some:

```
If Button == 0
    Return
    Set FailMessage to 0        ; never executed, in the ORIGINAL
    Set DisplayOnce to 0
```

Papyrus rejects the whole script for it — reported, confusingly, as
`(block statement) invalid token: =,` on the assignment. Since the statement
provably cannot run, replacing it with a `;NE:` marker changes no behaviour and
saves the script.

Measured: 17 statements across 5 scripts — FalloutNV 13 in 3
(`LegateCampMongrelCageScript`, `VERT4BloodborneStalkerScript`,
`VMS21aSupportScript`), Morroblivion 4 in 2. Oblivion and Nehrim have none.
The Morroblivion pair already compiled, and dropping dead code cannot change
what they do.

### The cross-ref declaration scan did not know `int`
<a id="cross-ref-scan-missed-int"></a>

`cross_ref.py` builds `script_all_vars` — the table `remote_type_of` consults
to type `Owner.member` — with its own regex over the SCTX text, and that regex
listed `short|long|float|ref`. `TYPE_MAP` and the PARSER'S `VAR_TYPES` both
accept `int`; only this one scan did not.

A member declared `int` therefore resolved to `''`, so `_typed_assign` saw no
target type and skipped the coercion it exists to apply:

```
VFSAtomicPimp.iChipTimeA = GameDaysPassed.GetValue()
value with type `Float` cannot be assigned to a variable with type `Int`
```

Measured declarations by keyword: FalloutNV **1,789 `int`** (of 7,837),
Oblivion 11, Nehrim 1, Morroblivion 0. `int` is legal TES4, so this is a shared
bug that FNV merely exposes at scale — the three TES4 plugins have 12 members
that were invisible to every cross-script type lookup.

### `GetIsReference` is an IDENTITY test, not an actor test
<a id="getisreference-not-an-actor-test"></a>

The row rendered `{ref} == {a0}` under the `AV` subject, and `AV` passes
`actor_func=True` into `_resolve_self_ref` — which promotes the receiver, and
the local it was assigned from, to `Actor`. So a TRIGGER script's
`set ThisTrigger to GetSelf` / `if ThisTrigger.GetIsReference <ref>` declared
`Actor Property ThisTrigger` and compared it against a property typed as the
script attached to the named record:

```
you can't compare type `Actor` with type `TES4_VHDOliverPlayerInRoomScript`
```

`GetIsReference` asks whether two references are the same object. It reads no
actor value and calls no actor-only native, so `OBJREF` is the right subject —
and a trigger, a door or a terminal is not an Actor, so the promotion was also
wrong on its own terms (the `as Actor` cast on a non-actor hazard this file
documents at #an-as-actor-cast-on-a-non-actor).

9 FNV scripts failed on this. The emitted comparison text is unchanged for
every TES4 call site — only the DECLARED type of the operands moves.

### A ref tested against `1` is still a null test
<a id="ref-compared-to-one"></a>

TES4 refs coerce to 0 when unset, so scripts test them against a literal. The
ordering forms (`ref > 0`, `ref >= 1`, `ref <= 0`) were already folded to
`!= None` / `== None`, and so was `ref == 0` — but `ref == 1` fell through to
the Bool-literal rule and emitted `ObjectReference == 1`, which the checker
rejects ("you can't compare type `ObjectReference` with type `Int`").

`== 1` means "is set", so it inverts: `ref == 1` → `ref != None`, and
`ref != 1` → `ref == None`.

Measured across all four plugins, this idiom appears only in FNV — 4 sites
(`LinkedRef == 1` twice, `Companion1REF != 1`, `Companion2REF != 1`). Oblivion,
Nehrim and Morroblivion have none once `ref`-declared names are separated from
similarly-spelled `short`/`Int` ones.

It applies to a DECLARED ref variable only (`_is_ref_variable`), never to a
ref-RETURNING command. Only a stored reference can be unset; a command without
a Papyrus native converts to an inert `0`, and rewriting that to `!= None`
would DECIDE a guard the inert-operand path exists to drop. The first attempt
skipped that distinction and broke `GetCrimeKnown ... == 1`, whose whole `||`
chain is supposed to collapse — caught by
`test_an_or_chain_that_loses_every_term_stays_shut`.

### A declaration can nest at ANY depth
<a id="declarations-nest-at-any-depth"></a>

TES4 variables are script-global wherever they are written, so the parser hoists
every `VarDecl` into one declaration list. The block hoist walked only
`block.body` — the block's IMMEDIATE statements — so a declaration inside an
`if` was never collected:

```
begin ScriptEffectStart
    if myself == player
        float randomTime                 ; <- invisible to the hoist
        set randomTime to 5.0 + 20.0/99.0 * GetRandomPercent
```

The assignment then emitted against a name Papyrus had never seen: "undefined
identifier `randomTime`". The hoist now uses `walk_stmts`, which already
recursed through `body`/`orelse`/`elifs` for other callers.

Measured: 12 FNV failures across 8 scripts (`randomTime`, `legToDisable`,
`mytarget`, `targetREF`, `rLink`). Zero TES4 scripts nest a declaration, so the
three Oblivion-family plugins are unaffected — but the fix is theirs too, since
nothing in TES4 forbids the shape.

## Weather holds are RE-APPLICATION in TES4, a LOCK in Skyrim
<a id="weather-holds-reapplication-vs-lock"></a>

`ForceActive(bool abOverride=false)` is the instant switch,
`SetActive(bool abOverride, bool abAccelerate)` the gradual one — signatures
verified against vanilla `Weather.psc`. WTHR/CLMT/REGN weather is fully
converted, so scripted weather moments drive the real converted records.

**`abOverride` must be FALSE on both.** Oblivion holds scripted weather by
CONTINUOUS RE-APPLICATION: the gate scripts re-force the storm every `GameMode`
pass while the player is near, and stop running when the ref unloads, after
which the sky rolls naturally. Skyrim's `abOverride=True` is a GLOBAL lock that
survives the caller unloading, so mapping to True let a fast-travel away from an
Oblivion gate strand `OblivionStormTamriel` over the whole world forever — the
release call lives in the same unloaded script's update loop and can never run.

## Commands whose Skyrim equivalent is a different SUBSYSTEM
<a id="equivalent-in-a-different-subsystem"></a>

Where Skyrim has no matching call, the engine's own mechanism is preferred over
a Papyrus approximation.

- **`ForceFlee` / `Flee`** (UESP index 407): Skyrim has no flee call — fleeing
  is driven by the Confidence actor value, so dropping the actor to Cowardly and
  re-evaluating its package makes the ENGINE break off combat.
- **`SetForceRun`** → the `SpeedMult` actor value; Skyrim has no force-run flag
  and the AV is what the engine reads for movement speed. Its getter reads the
  live sneak state for the same reason. `setforcerun` is deliberately absent
  from the plain rows: it carried `SetDontMove`, the exact INVERSE, unreachable
  only because the handler runs first
  ([the shadowing defect](#13-twelve-commands-were-treated)).
- **`GetPCFaction{Murder,Attack,Steal}`** have no native, so they are rebuilt
  from the crime-gold split: Steal = non-violent, Attack = violent below the
  murder bounty, Murder = violent at or above. All 14 Skyrim.esm crime factions
  use murder=1000 assault=40, which the importer also writes. One shared
  `GetCrimeGoldViolent()` had shadowed every murder branch (`FGExpulsionScript`,
  `TGCastOut`, both MGExpulsion scripts). `IsPCAMurderer` is the 1000-gold band;
  `> 0` was the *Attack* test and made the player a murderer for a bar brawl.
- **`GetNextRef`** — OBSE's walk over every reference in the loaded cells. An
  ACTOR walk becomes repeated `FindRandomActorFromRef` sampling: the authored
  loop re-assigns the variable each pass, so a fresh sample per pass is exactly
  the iteration it asked for. `GetFirstRef` carries the form TYPE and has its
  own handler — only form type 69 (actors) has an Actor-typed primitive behind
  it. Neither may be neutralised: listing them as inert left the loop body
  walking a ref that was never assigned.
- **`ResetFallDamageTimer`** (OBSE) has a console command (opcode 4404) but no
  Papyrus binding, so the substitute is the GMST the fall-damage formula reads
  (`fJumpFallHeightMin`, default 600): pushing the threshold beyond any
  reachable fall makes the landing survivable, which is the whole observable
  behaviour. `TES4Polyfill` restores the original on release.
- **`ModAmountSoldStolen`** adds GOLD to the "amount fenced" counter, which
  Skyrim exposes only as a condition function, so it is backed by the
  synthesized `TES4GoldFenced` global — NOT the vanilla "Items Stolen" stat,
  which counts items and is engine-driven on every theft.
- **`GetLocalGravity`** (OBSE) reads per-axis gravity on the calling reference.
  Papyrus exposes no accessor (the value lives in the `fGravity` INI setting,
  present in both engines and reachable from neither script language), so the
  literal constant IS the faithful translation: Skyrim gravity is a world
  constant pointing straight down, so X and Y are always 0 and only Z carries
  the magnitude, signed to match OBSE's downward-acceleration callers.
- **`GetPlayerControlsDisabled`** has no getter: Skyrim exposes the two WRITERS
  as natives (`Game.DisablePlayerControls`/`EnablePlayerControls`) and nothing
  to read them back, so the writers also shadow the state into a synthesized
  global and the read returns that. Flattening the read to 0 was actively wrong
  rather than merely inert — `MG18Script` polls it three times to sequence
  Mannimarco's confrontation, and a constant 0 made the force-greet branch
  (`== 1`) permanently false while the combat branch (`== 0`) fired
  immediately, so Mannimarco never spoke and attacked at once.
- **`CreateFullActorCopy`** places a fresh instance of the actor's BASE, which
  is the copy TES4's callers use it for.
- **`SetActorRefraction`** has no Papyrus refraction control; a translucent
  alpha fade is the closest visual, and 0 restores full opacity.
- **`GetAttacked`** → `IsAlarmed`, the nearest Skyrim state: an actor that has
  noticed a hostile action against it.
- **`HasVampireFed`** reads `PlayerVampireQuestScript.VampireStatus`, which is 1
  exactly while the vampire has recently fed.
- **`IsAnimPlaying`** is exposed by the behavior graph as an animation variable,
  cast to Int because TES4 call sites compare and assign 0/1. The variable is
  `bAnimPlaying`, declared and written by every animated-object graph the
  converter generates (`asset_convert/havok/hkx_animobject.py`): 1 while a
  held one-shot or a LOOP sequence state is active, 0 in `Rest`, in a hold
  and in a hold-less CLAMP state
  ([bAnimPlaying](asset_convert_animation.md#playing-variable)). It still
  reads 0, with an error line, on a receiver that has no generated graph
  (vanilla's shared Autoplay graph, no sequences, 3D not loaded) and on a
  graph built before the variable existed.
- **`IsCasting`** (OBSE) asks "is this actor playing a cast animation", which
  the animation graph answers natively — no SKSE dependency.
- **`GetIsCreature`**: Skyrim marks people with the `ActorTypeNPC` race keyword,
  and converted creatures use generated races without it.
- **`LoopGroup`** plays an idle on repeat; `PlayGamebryoAnimation` is Skyrim's
  own looping Gamebryo-animation call.
- **`IsOnGround`** (OBSE) is the complement of `IsFlying` — both engines only
  distinguish "supported by the ground" from "not".
- **`IsModLoaded "Foo.esp"`**: `Game.GetFormFromFile` returns `None` for an
  unloaded file, answering the same question in vanilla Papyrus. `Morrowind_ob`
  guards every Oblivion XP hand-off with it.
- **`print`/`printc`** write to the console log; `Debug.Trace` is Papyrus's own
  log write, the same capability.
- **`GetPCExpelled`/`SetPCExpelled`** have exact natives on both sides —
  `Faction.psc` declares `IsPlayerExpelled()` and `SetPlayerExpelled(bool)`.
  Reading it as `GetFactionRank(...) < 0` was asymmetric with the setter, which
  touches an engine flag and never rank, so nothing ever drove rank negative and
  every read was permanently false.
- **`IsArrested`** is "serving a jail sentence", NOT faction expulsion, which is
  what all four spellings used to emit. `Actor.psc` declares
  `bool Function IsArrested() native` (condition form `GetArrestedState`, index
  656). All 9 TES4 sites are jail mechanics — the prison cell doors, the
  Leyawiin jailor, Amusei, the tutorial prison start, and
  `TG00FindThievesGuildScript`, whose stage 10 is the ENTRY POINT of the Thieves
  Guild questline. Expulsion is never set on `TES4CyrodiilCrimeFaction` for the
  player, so every one read false.

## Reads Skyrim genuinely cannot answer
<a id="reads-skyrim-cannot-answer"></a>

Checked against `Actor.psc`, `ObjectReference.psc`, `Form.psc`, `Game.psc` and
`Utility.psc`, and absent from all five:

| TES4 read | Why there is no target |
|---|---|
| `GetObjectType`, `IsDoor`/`IsActivator`/`IsContainer` | Skyrim's form-type numbering differs entirely; `GetType` is SKSE |
| `GetDisplayName` / `SetName` | no name accessor on any vanilla script |
| `GetGodMode` | third-party SKSE plugins only |
| `GetModIndex` | Papyrus cannot read load order |
| `isKeyPressed`, `getControl`, `getMenuHasTrait` | no vanilla input or UI API |
| `SetPlayerSkeletonPath` | Skyrim's skeleton is fixed by race |
| `GetPlayerHasLastRiddenHorse` | the engine tracks no "last ridden" horse |
| `HasFlames` | Skyrim lights carry no scriptable flame state |
| `GetGameRestarted`, `IsPlayerMovingIntoNewSpace` | a one-off engine transition Skyrim does not expose; False is safe because the guarded body is a re-initialisation allowed to be skipped |

**`WakeUpPC` is the instructive one.** It kicks the player OUT OF SLEEP — it
does not move them, change the camera or play an animation, so the old mapping
to `Game.ForceThirdPerson()` did none of the right things. No native in
`Game`/`Debug`/`Actor`/`ObjectReference` ends an active sleep and SKSE registers
none (grepped every `NativeFunction` in `references/skse64-master`); vanilla's
closest case, the Dark Brotherhood abduction, runs its whole sequence inside
`OnSleepStart` rather than waking the player with a function. That is exactly
where the converted body already runs: all 5 TES4 call sites sit in a `MenuMode`
block reading `isPCSleeping`, which this converter routes into
`OnSleepStart`/`OnSleepStop`. So the surrounding code runs at the right moment
and only "cut the sleep short" has no target — a no-op keeps that faithful and
visible instead of inventing a side effect the original never had.

**`PositionCell`** teleports to raw coordinates in a named cell; `MoveTo` takes
a TARGET REFERENCE and Skyrim exposes no cell-coordinate move.
**`GetInWorldSpace`** becomes a WorldSpace comparison, but `GetPlayerInSEWorld`
stays literal 0: an SI interior has no worldspace and no invariant to key on,
and 11 of 16 sites test `== 0` (suppression guards, right in Cyrodiil).

## OBSE constructs with no shape to translate
<a id="obse-constructs-no-shape-to-translate"></a>

- **`runScriptLine "<console command>"`** compiles and runs a console command at
  runtime. Papyrus cannot execute the console at all, and `Morrowind_ob` uses it
  exclusively to poke the OPTIONAL ObXP mod's globals — not part of the
  conversion, so there is no target even in principle. The payload carries
  OBSE's escaped-quote token and apostrophes, which as emitted broke the Papyrus
  string literal it was pasted into.
- **`SetEventHandler "OnDeath" <script> "object"::Player`** registers a callback.
  Papyrus binds an event by DECLARING it (`Event OnDeath()`) on a script
  attached to the form, so there is no registration API of this shape. The
  argument syntax carries OBSE's `::` type-tag operator, which is not Papyrus
  syntax at all and failed the parse of every script importing this one.
- **`ar_*` / `sv_*`** are OBSE's dynamic arrays and string-variables. Papyrus has
  real arrays and strings but nothing equivalent, and the surrounding logic
  reads them element-by-element — there is nothing to translate call-for-call.
  The `sv_` builder has its own handler; the inert catch-all would leave it
  undefined.
- **`forEach <it> <- <container> ... loop`** converts as the OPENER only; the
  walker comments out the body (`emit/script.py`), which is what makes the
  iterator's absence harmless.
- **`MessageBoxEX`**'s `|`-separated button list has no Papyrus equivalent, so
  only the message text survives — the closest faithful rendering without a UI
  menu.
- **Elys Music Control** (`emcMusicStop`, `emcSetMusicHold`,
  `emcIsBattleOverridden`, bundled with Nehrim) controls the PLAYLIST rather
  than naming a track, so there is no equivalent even with MUSC authored.
- **The math globals** (`sin`, `cos`, `atan2`...) are written with a bare
  whitespace operand (`set x to sin angleZ`), which is why they reached the
  Papyrus parser unconverted as "no viable alternative at input 'sin'".
  `Math.psc` has the same set and BOTH engines take and return DEGREES, so no
  unit conversion is needed. `exp`/`log` have no native — see `_EXP_POLYFILL`.
- **The raw-input family** is kept as ONE group rather than enumerated a build
  at a time: that is how `disableKey` survived to fail on its own.

## Commands that must NOT be promoted to `Actor`
<a id="commands-that-must-not-promote"></a>

`objref_shared` marks rows whose Papyrus method is declared on
`ObjectReference`. The subject must stay un-promoted because TES4 calls these on
plain scenery and an `Actor Property` on a STAT or ACTI never binds, so the read
comes back `None`:

- **`GetPos`/`GetAngle`/`GetStartingAngle`** — the Xeddefen puzzle rotates
  `SEXedPuzStatue1-5`, which are STATs.
- **`sms`/`StopMagicShaderVisuals`** — `EffectShader.Stop` takes an
  `ObjectReference`, and TES4 casts these shaders on markers and statues (the
  SE05 spell markers).
- **`GetInSameCell`** — `GetParentCell` is an `ObjectReference` method.

The reverse case is `_ACTOR_ONLY_FUNCTIONS`: commands naming their target as an
ARGUMENT (`GetDeadCount X`, `SetEssential X 0`) are declared on `ActorBase`, so
a bare occurrence says nothing about the script's OWN type. They are listed only
to stop `_infer_extends` upgrading an ACTI or DOOR script to `extends Actor`,
which will not bind; the call site still needs its cast. A separate set covers
commands whose Papyrus signature declares an `Actor` PARAMETER (`StartCombat`,
`IsHostileToActor`, `Get`/`SetRelationshipRank`), where a script-typed argument
must be cast or the checker rejects it; `SetLookAt`, `Say` and `GetDistance` are
absent because their parameters are `ObjectReference`, which converts
implicitly. Full rules: [Actor promotion](#actor-promotion-must-follow-declaring).

**`ref.` commands written with a COMMA** are the third case. Oblivion let the
receiver follow a comma instead of a dot — `StopCombat, Player` and
`IsInCombat, Player == 1` mean `Player.StopCombat` / `Player.IsInCombat`.
Generic comma-stripping treats what follows as an argument, so these emitted
`IsInCombat(Player)` ("function takes 0 parameters not 1") or dropped the token
and acted on the wrong actor. The set is derived from the `ref.` rows with an
empty argument column in `docs/reference/skyrim_commands.md`, intersected with
`FUNCTION_MAP`; `IsInCombat`'s "Integer" column there is its RETURN type, not a
parameter.


## script_convert: measurements and failure modes
<a id="scriptconvert-measurements-failure-modes"></a>

The working log behind the architecture contract.

### What the baseline IS

`temp/psc_semantic/` matches **HEAD**. The working tree is not expected to
match it: the current output is *HEAD plus the intentional bug fixes* recorded
in [script_conversion_bugs.md](../commentary/script_convert.md), which is the ledger
for this rewrite — 17 numbered, dated entries marked FIXED / LATENT / REPLACED,
each naming what was measured and in which scripts.

So the changed-count is **not noise and not debt**. It is the footprint of
those deliberate fixes, and every script in it should be traceable to a
numbered entry.

🛑 **If the count GROWS, you had better have a very good reason.** It is a
justification threshold, not a hard cap — a refactor legitimately uncovers real
defects, and §14, §16 and §17 of the ledger were all found exactly that way,
by the tree and the text scan disagreeing. What is forbidden is growth that
nobody looked at. When the number moves up:

1. Name every newly-changed script (`--show`).
2. Decide, per script, whether it is a fix or a regression.
3. A fix gets **a new numbered entry in `script_conversion_bugs.md`** in the
   existing format: what was measured, how many sites in which plugins, the
   authored-vs-shipped-vs-correct comparison, and how it was found.
4. A regression gets reverted.

Growth without steps 1-3 is how a rewrite quietly ships twelve behaviour
changes because "the number only moved a little".

A change is acceptable when **all four** hold:

1. **No CharacterGen script changed.** The tutorial dungeon is the most
   play-tested content in the project and every new game passes through it.
   `psc_semantic_diff` exits 1 and names the file. **Any gated diff is a
   regression until proven otherwise: revert first, diagnose second** — never
   explain it away in the pass that introduced it.
2. **Every semantic change is accounted for** in
   `script_conversion_bugs.md` — see the threshold rule above.
3. **All scripts compile, 0 failures.**
4. **No fitness metric moved away from its target.**

`Morrowind_ob.esm` is non-negotiable: the only plugin exercising
`ctx.master_export`, and at ~18,000 scripts the largest corpus.

🛑 **A stale baseline makes the whole guarantee meaningless.** Re-snapshot
(`psc_semantic_diff.py snapshot --all`) from a clean build before starting, and
confirm `compare` reports **0 changed** — that zero is what proves the net is
measuring the tree you are actually working from.

---

### S3 closed the round trip (2026-08-29)

`emit_call` flattened its parsed argument nodes back into a TES4 source string
and handed it to `_emit_function`, which re-split and re-parsed it. Measured
before cutting, since the cut depends on the two channels agreeing:

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Calls reaching `_emit_function` with nodes | 44,322 |
| Where `args_str` differed from the rebuilt node text | **0** |
| Expression conversions through the tree | 30,315 |
| Falling back to the string scanner | **0** |
| `parser.parse` calls per script, after | **1.000** |

`args_str` is gone from `_emit_function`, from all four argument accessors and
from the row engine's `_Args`. `_convert_expression` and `_tree_expression` are
deleted -- 38 call sites became `arg_expr(n)`, which emits from the node.

**reparse-round-trip measures the ROUND TRIP, not `emit_source`.** The old pattern counted every
`emit_source` mention, which was right while it fed the re-parse. It is now a
node->text formatter for `;NE:`/`;TODO:` markers and for keying a lookup on the
authored spelling -- neither re-enters the parser. The pattern was narrowed to
`_convert_expression(` / `_tree_expression` / `parse(emit_source` /
`tokenize(emit_source`, and reparse-round-trip is 0.

**One real regression, caught by the semantic diff and fixed.** Routing the
printf helpers at `_format_string_call` onto the node list made them ignore the
trimmed argument string their callers had built: `message "Rank %.0f Fireball",
SpellRank, 10` emitted the trailing display-duration as text
(`+ (10 as String)`), 73 scripts. Fixed by passing argument INDEXES down instead
of a rebuilt string, so the trim happens on nodes and both helpers stop
reconstructing text at all.

### ms-per-script is noisy; sample it before believing it

ms-per-script is a median of 5 runs x 40 iterations, which is not enough to reject
background load. It read 0.75-0.82 ms three times during S2 -- an apparent
1.8x regression -- while six clean samples on the same code gave 0.452-0.495
(median 0.465 against a 0.443 baseline, i.e. 1.05x). Every high reading
coincided with another job on the machine.

So a single ms-per-script flag is not evidence. Re-sample it 5-6 times with nothing else
running before acting; a real regression holds its value across samples.

### The baseline is not a scratchpad

`--update-baseline` used to write whatever it measured. That makes the whole
fitness suite advisory: add a violation, refresh the baseline, and
`--fail-on-regression` compares the file against itself and reports
`no regressions`. It happened -- 5 plain-`#` comments were added to
`psc_semantic_diff.py` and enshrined in the same session.

`--update-baseline` now REFUSES when any metric moved away from its target and
prints which. `--accept-regression` overrides it, and the override is the point:
accepting one becomes a deliberate, visible act rather than a side effect of
running the tool.

🛑 **Refresh the baseline only at a stage EXIT, never mid-edit.** The metrics are
package-wide totals, so a new violation in one file nets out against unrelated
improvements elsewhere in the same run and the guard never sees it. Order:
fix, verify with `--fail-on-regression`, THEN refresh.

## 7. Why it is this way — the failure modes to not repeat
<a id="7-why-this-way-failure"></a>

- **A stage's exit criterion must be a STRUCTURAL FACT, never a deletion list.**
  "Delete these helpers" was satisfied by *moving* them: every named function
  went away, the corpus stayed byte-identical, and the package shrank 54 lines
  while `parse()` still had zero callers. Write it as a property that cannot be
  faked — which is what the fitness metrics are.
- **Build the foundation and USE it in the same change.** An unwired foundation
  is indistinguishable from dead code, and the next change routes around it.
- **Count lines, not branches.** "98 of 197 branches are identical" sounds like
  thousands; it was 356.
- **A metric that cries wolf gets deleted.** The naive form of invariant 2 fires
  32 times and flags `tes4/parser.py` (which legitimately takes TES4 source) and
  `tes5/blocks.py` (which legitimately is the Papyrus classifier). Scope it, and
  give every exemption a comment saying why.
- **Comment volume is not comment value.** The comment-to-code ratio correlates
  *inversely* with code quality here: `converter.py` sits at 0.59 and the clean
  AST layer at 0.13, because prose was compensating for code that could not
  express its own intent. Compression is the comment counts down with every anchor kept — the same
  knowledge in fewer characters, never fewer facts.
- 🛑 **Inline comments track COMPLEXITY, but the comment rules stand.**
  Measured across the package: inline comments per 10 code lines run **1.16**
  at complexity 1-5, 2.18 at 6-10, 2.80 at 11-25 and **7.42 at 26+** — a 6.4x
  spread. `_emit_function` (complexity 295) carried 869 inline comments against
  882 code lines. The correlation shows prose compensating for code that cannot
  state its own intent — `converter.py` sits at a 0.59 comment-to-code ratio
  against 0.13 for the clean AST layer — so it argues for KEEPING the pressure
  on, not for exempting the comments.

  An earlier revision of this section concluded the opposite and told future
  agents not to add a docstring-only rule. That is superseded: `inline-comments`
  and `stray-comments` are gated at 0 by `tools/validate/code_rules.py`, and
  evidence that must survive (a measurement, a census count, a reverted attempt)
  goes to a `docs/` file cited by a `See:` line, which the gate verifies
  resolves. Compression keeps every fact and drops the narration.

  What is forbidden at any complexity: a comment that narrates the next line.
  If a function of complexity <10 needs inline signposts, the docstring is
  missing, not the comments.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Plan
<a id="step-step-implementation-plan"></a>

### Step 1: Export Quest Stage Scripts

The TES4 QUST export currently only captures stage index, flags, and log text. It misses 1,881 per-stage SCTX (result scripts) and per-stage CTDA (conditions). These are INDX → QSDT → CTDA → SCHR → SCDA → SCTX ordered subrecords.

**Changes to `tes4_export/record_types/dialog_misc.py::export_QUST()`:**
- After QSDT, check for SCHR/SCTX subrecords following the stage entry
- Export as `Stage[i].Log[j].ResultScript=<escaped source>`
- Export `Stage[i].Log[j].SCHR.Type=<int>` for script type context

### Step 2: Build Cross-Reference Graph

Before converting any script, build a lookup table from the export data:

1. **FormID → EditorID map**: From ALL record types (ACTI, NPC_, CREA, QUST, WEAP, etc.)
2. **EditorID → Script name map**: From SCRI fields on all records → SCPT EditorID
3. **SCPT FormID → SCHR.Type**: Script type classification
4. **QUST EditorID → variable list**: Quest scripts' variables are globally accessible

This graph enables:
- Resolving `set SomeRef.VarName to value` → `(SomeRef as ScriptType).VarName = value`
- Determining correct `extends` class when SCHR.Type=0 (check if attached to NPC_→Actor)
- Property declaration for all referenced FormIDs

### Step 3: Script Type Classification

| Signal | Extends | Priority |
|--------|---------|----------|
| SCHR.Type = 1 | `Quest` | Highest |
| SCHR.Type = 256 | `ActiveMagicEffect` | Highest |
| Attached to NPC_/CREA via SCRI | `Actor` | High |
| Contains `ScriptEffectStart` block | `ActiveMagicEffect` | Medium |
| Contains `SetStage`/`GetStage` as self | `Quest` | Medium |
| Calls `Kill`, `GetAV`, `StartCombat` on self | `Actor` | Low |
| Default (SCHR.Type = 0) | `ObjectReference` | Lowest |

### Step 4: Function Mapping (Complete)

The existing FUNCTION_MAP has ~90 entries. Full Oblivion has ~200+ vanilla functions. We need three tiers:

**Tier 1: Direct equivalents (~100 functions)**
Same or very similar Papyrus function exists. Mechanical substitution.

**Tier 2: Polyfill required (~50 functions)**
Function exists in Oblivion but not Papyrus. A polyfill script provides the equivalent:
- `GetRandomPercent` → `Utility.RandomInt(0, 99)`
- `GetButtonPressed` → Queue-based message system via polyfill
- `PlayGroup` → **routes on WHAT THE TARGET IS, never on call syntax**:
  animated OBJECTS (ACTI/DOOR/STAT/MSTT — a NiControllerManager NIF that keeps
  its TES4 sequence names) get `PlayAnimation("Forward")`; ACTORS
  (NPC_/CREA/ACHR/ACRE, and the leveled lists LVLC/LVLN that place one) get
  `Debug.SendAnimationEvent()` (animation group name
  mapping), because `PlayAnimation()` on an actor corrupts its behavior graph.
  Resolve the base record via `CrossRefGraph.get_base_signature()`; an unknown
  target keeps the event (inert on an object, never harmful to an actor).
  `PlayAnimation` is an ObjectReference method, so an explicit ref must play on
  THAT ref, not on `Self`.
  Sending every explicit-ref call to `SendAnimationEvent` broke **every
  lever-operated secret door in the game** (196 calls / 86 scripts: Anvil
  Castle ×4, Bravil Castle, Anga, mine traps). CharacterGen's
  `CGPrisonSecretWallRef.playgroup forward 1` went inert, so Renault threw the
  switch, the quest advanced, and the wall never moved — while the SELF-call on
  the next TES4 line converted correctly. **When one of a pair of identical TES4
  statements converts and the other doesn't, suspect the branch that
  distinguishes them.** Guarded by `TestPlayGroupTargetRouting`.
  <a id="playgroup-variable-target"></a>
  A receiver that is a ref VARIABLE has no EditorID, so `get_base_signature()`
  reads `''` and the call used to take the event unconditionally:
  `set targetref to getParentRef` / `targetref.playgroup forward 0` moved the
  lever and never the gate. The variable is now TRACED, and promoted to
  `PlayAnimation` only on positive proof — every condition must hold, and
  anything short of it keeps the inert event:
  - every assignment to it in the script is the same bare `getSelf` or
    `getParentRef` (`symbols.assignment_sources`; `other.getParentRef`, a named
    ref, a literal or a second command all disqualify it);
  - no other script assigns it (`CrossRefGraph.remotely_assigned`: every
    `set Owner.var to X` in SCPT sources and in INFO / QUST-stage result
    scripts, masters included, keyed on the owning script; a write whose owner
    resolves to no script vetoes the variable NAME);
  - it is not declared `Actor`;
  - `getSelf`: every record carrying the script has the same signature;
    `getParentRef`: every such record is placed, every placement names an
    enable parent (XESP, indexed as `record_parent` by the shared
    `index_record_details`), and every parent's base has the same signature;
  - that signature is a placeable object that can carry a sequence
    (`SEQUENCE_OBJECT_SIGS`: ACTI/DOOR/CONT/FLOR/FURN/LIGH/MISC/STAT) — a
    whitelist, because "not an actor" is not "an animated object".

  The proof is closed-world: a master's script is judged on the master's own
  placements, and a later plugin that places the same base under an actor
  parent does not re-emit it. A promoted variable target does not get
  `ReleaseBreakaway`: `_needs_havok_release` resolves the receiver by EditorID.
  Guarded by `TestPlayGroupVariableTarget`.
- `GetPos X/Y/Z` → `GetPositionX()` / `GetPositionY()` / `GetPositionZ()`
- `SetPos X/Y/Z` → `SetPosition(x, y, z)` (needs axis decomposition)
- `GetAngle X/Y/Z` → `GetAngleX()` / `GetAngleY()` / `GetAngleZ()`
- `ShowMap` → `Game.ShowFirstPersonGeometry(true)` (approximate)
- `SetCrimeGold` → `Faction.SetCrimeGold(amount, false)`
- `GetInCell` → Polyfill: compare `GetParentCell() == targetCell`
- `GetSelf` → `Self` (keyword, not function call)
- `IsActionRef player` → `akActionRef == Game.GetPlayer()` (event parameter)
- `PMS`/`SMS` (play/stop magic shader) → `Game.ShakeCamera()` (approximate)
- `PlaceAtMe` with persistent flag → `Game.CreateReferenceAtLocation()`

**Tier 3: No equivalent (~50 functions)**
Functions with no Papyrus equivalent. Emit `;TODO:` comments:
- `CloseOblivionGate` — Oblivion-specific
- `SetQuestObject` — Engine-level, no Papyrus API
- `PurgeCellBuffers` — Engine memory management
- `SetCellOwnership` — No direct Papyrus equivalent
- `Reset3DState` — Rendering internals
- `ShowMap` (discovery) — Partial via `WorldSpace.SetMapMarkerVisible()`

### Step 5: GameMode → OnUpdate Conversion

Every `begin GameMode` block becomes:

```papyrus
Event OnInit()
  RegisterForSingleUpdate(0.5)  ; Default interval
EndEvent

Event OnUpdate()
  ; ... converted GameMode body ...
  RegisterForSingleUpdate(0.5)  ; Re-register at end
EndEvent
```

**Interval heuristic:**
- Script uses `GetSecondsPassed` → 0.1s (fast poller)
- Script checks distance/position → 0.5s (spatial check)
- Script only checks flags/stages → 1.0s (slow check)
- Default → 0.5s

**`begin MenuMode <id>` blocks: comment out, do NOT merge into OnUpdate**

A `begin MenuMode <id>` block runs *only while that specific menu is open* —
1014 = lockpicking, 1030 = class menu, 1002 = inventory, 1023 = quest/map,
1022 = magic. Skyrim has no per-menu event, and `Utility.IsInMenuMode()` only
answers "is *some* menu open", so **there is nothing to convert the trigger to.**

Merging these bodies into the GameMode `OnUpdate` loop (which is what the
converter used to do, with no guard at all) makes them run on the first tick as
if every menu were open at once. `MQ01Script` is the worst case: its
`MenuMode 1014` and `MenuMode 1030` blocks call `setstage MQ01 70` / `84`
unconditionally, so on a new game the tutorial quest blew straight through its
stage machine and hit stage 100's `stopquest MQ01` — this was the
"MQ01 starts then immediately fails / jumps to the last stage" bug.

The converter now emits MenuMode bodies as a converted-but-commented block after
`OnUpdate`, so the trigger can't fire and the translation stays available for
anyone hand-porting it to a Papyrus menu hook. Only ~11 MenuMode blocks exist in
all of Oblivion.esm, 5 of them in MQ01Script.

**Locals whose name collides with a TES4 command**

`DiveRockScript` declares `short message`. A local is registered under BOTH its
original TES4 spelling and its Papyrus-safe rename (`message` → `myMessage`,
since `Message` is a Papyrus type): the body still spells it the TES4 way, so if
only the safe name is registered, `if message == 0` is compiled as the TES4
`Message` *command* and comes out as `If Debug.Notification("") == 0`.

### Step 6: Variable → Property Conversion

```
TES4: short doOnce            → Int Property doOnce = 0 Auto
TES4: float timer             → Float Property timer = 0.0 Auto
TES4: ref mySelf              → ObjectReference Property mySelf Auto
```

**Special cases:**
- Variables used as boolean flags (short with only 0/1 values) → `Bool Property ... Auto`
- `ref` variables that always hold actors → `Actor Property ... Auto`
- Quest variables accessed cross-script → public properties on Quest script

**`_property_refs` MUST be keyed on the Papyrus-safe name**

Everything that writes a property ref — `_add_scro_ref` (SCRO preload) and
`_convert_ref` (body conversion) — has to key `_property_refs` on
`_safe_property_name(edid)`, which is also what `_collect_scro_properties` writes
into the VMAD. Keying on the raw EditorID anywhere creates a *second* entry for
any EditorID that gets renamed, and many Oblivion EditorIDs collide with vanilla
Skyrim script names (`MS14` → `myMS14`).

When that happened, the generic `Quest` type seeded from the SCRO and the
specific `TES4_MS14Script` promoted by `_convert_ref` lived under different keys.
The "don't downgrade a promoted type" guard compared the wrong key and never
fired, so the *generic* type won the declaration and the script compiled to
`Quest Property myMS14` with a body calling `myMS14.QuestDone` →
`field or property QuestDone not found`. Same root cause for `GoHomeRythe`.

### Step 7: Expression Conversion

TES4 expressions have function calls inline:
```
if GetActorValue Health > 50
set myVar to GetDistance player
```

Papyrus requires:
```papyrus
If GetActorValue("Health") > 50
myVar = GetDistance(Game.GetPlayer())
```

Key transformations:
1. Actor value names become string parameters: `Health` → `"Health"`
2. Function calls get parenthesized arguments
3. `player` → `Game.GetPlayer()`
4. `set X to Y` → `X = Y`
5. `let X := Y` (OBSE) → `X = Y`
6. `X <> Y` → `X != Y`
7. `&&` / `||` already valid in Papyrus

### Step 8: INFO Result Script → VMAD Fragments

Each INFO ResultScript becomes a Papyrus fragment:

```papyrus
; TES4_TIF__<InfoFormID>.psc
ScriptName TES4_TIF__<InfoFormID> extends TopicInfo Hidden

Function Fragment_0()
  ; converted result script body
EndFunction
```

The import script must populate INFO VMAD with the fragment reference. VMAD structure:
```
VMAD {
  Version: 5
  ObjectFormat: 2
  Scripts: []  (empty — no persistent scripts)
  ScriptFragments: {
    UnknownByte: 0
    FileName: "TES4_TIF__<InfoFormID>"
    Fragments: [
      { Unknown: 0, ScriptName: "TES4_TIF__<InfoFormID>", FragmentName: "Fragment_0" }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Step 9: Quest Stage Script → VMAD Fragments

Each QUST stage script becomes a function in a quest fragment script:

```papyrus
; TES4_QF_<QuestEditorID>.psc
ScriptName TES4_QF_<QuestEditorID> extends Quest Hidden

Function Fragment_Stage_0010_Item_0()
  ; converted stage 10 script body
EndFunction

Function Fragment_Stage_0020_Item_0()
  ; converted stage 20 script body
EndFunction
```

QUST VMAD gets populated with:
```
VMAD {
  Scripts: [{ name: "TES4_QF_<QuestEditorID>", properties: [...] }]
  ScriptFragments: {
    FileName: "TES4_QF_<QuestEditorID>"
    Fragments: [
      { StageIndex: 10, Unknown: 0, StageIndex2: 10,
        ScriptName: "TES4_QF_<QuestEditorID>",
        FragmentName: "Fragment_Stage_0010_Item_0" },
      ...
    ]
  }
}
```

### Step 10: Polyfill Library

Create `TES4Polyfill.psc` — a utility script providing functions that don't exist in vanilla Papyrus:

```papyrus
ScriptName TES4Polyfill extends Quest
{Utility functions for converted TES4 scripts. Attach to a quest and access via property.}

; --- Random ---
Int Function GetRandomPercent() Global
  Return Utility.RandomInt(0, 99)
EndFunction

; --- Cell comparison ---
Bool Function IsInCell(ObjectReference akRef, Cell akCell) Global
  Return akRef.GetParentCell() == akCell
EndFunction

; --- Timer utility ---
Float Function GetSecondsPassed() Global
  ; Papyrus has no frame delta. Return update interval estimate.
  Return 0.5
EndFunction

; --- Actor value wrappers with TES4 AV name resolution ---
Float Function GetTES4ActorValue(Actor akActor, String avName) Global
  ; Maps TES4 attribute/skill names to TES5 equivalents
  If avName == "Strength"
    Return akActor.GetActorValue("UnarmedDamage")
  ElseIf avName == "Intelligence"
    Return akActor.GetActorValue("Magicka")
  ElseIf avName == "Willpower"
    Return akActor.GetActorValue("MagickaRate")
  ElseIf avName == "Agility"
    Return akActor.GetActorValue("SpeedMult")
  ElseIf avName == "Speed"
    Return akActor.GetActorValue("SpeedMult")
  ElseIf avName == "Endurance"
    Return akActor.GetActorValue("HealRate")
  ElseIf avName == "Personality"
    Return akActor.GetActorValue("Speechcraft")
  ElseIf avName == "Luck"
    Return 50.0  ; No equivalent
  ElseIf avName == "Fatigue"
    Return akActor.GetActorValue("Stamina")
  ElseIf avName == "Armorer"
    Return akActor.GetActorValue("Smithing")
  ElseIf avName == "Athletics"
    Return akActor.GetActorValue("Stamina")
  ElseIf avName == "Blade"
    Return akActor.GetActorValue("OneHanded")
  ElseIf avName == "Blunt"
    Return akActor.GetActorValue("TwoHanded")
  ElseIf avName == "HandToHand"
    Return akActor.GetActorValue("UnarmedDamage")
  ElseIf avName == "Mysticism"
    Return akActor.GetActorValue("Alteration")
  ElseIf avName == "Mercantile"
    Return akActor.GetActorValue("Speechcraft")
  ElseIf avName == "Security"
    Return akActor.GetActorValue("Lockpicking")
  ElseIf avName == "Acrobatics"
    Return akActor.GetActorValue("SpeedMult")
  Else
    Return akActor.GetActorValue(avName)
  EndIf
EndFunction

; --- PlayGroup approximation ---
Function PlayAnimationGroup(ObjectReference akRef, String groupName, Bool abForward) Global
  ; TES4 PlayGroup → TES5 animation event
  If groupName == "Forward"
    Debug.SendAnimationEvent(akRef, "IdleForceDefaultState")
  ElseIf groupName == "Backward"
    Debug.SendAnimationEvent(akRef, "IdleForceDefaultState")
  ElseIf groupName == "SpecialIdle"
    Debug.SendAnimationEvent(akRef, "IdleForceDefaultState")
  Else
    Debug.SendAnimationEvent(akRef, "IdleForceDefaultState")
  EndIf
EndFunction

; --- MessageBox with button tracking ---
; Note: Full MessageBox conversion requires creating Message form records.
; This provides a basic notification fallback.
Function ShowMessage(String text) Global
  Debug.Notification(text)
EndFunction
```

### Step 11: VMAD Binary Generation

The import script (`tes5_import`) needs a VMAD writer to attach scripts to records.

**VMAD binary format (version 5, object format 2):**
```
I16  version (5)
I16  objectFormat (2)
U16  scriptCount
  For each script:
    WSTRING  scriptName
    U8       flags (0=local, 1=inherited)
    U16      propertyCount
    For each property:
      WSTRING  propertyName
      U8       propertyType (1=Object, 2=String, 3=Int, 4=Float, 5=Bool)
      U8       propertyFlags (0x01=readonly)
      <value depending on type>
        Object:  U16(1) + U16(aliasId) + U32(formID)
        String:  WSTRING
        Int:     I32
        Float:   F32
        Bool:    U8
```

**For QUST ScriptFragments:**
```
After scripts array:
  U8   unknownByte (0)
  WSTRING fileName
  U16  fragmentCount
  For each fragment:
    U16  stageIndex
    U16  unknown (0)
    I32  stageIndex2 (same as above, signed)
    U8   unknown2 (1)
    WSTRING scriptName
    WSTRING fragmentName ("Fragment_Stage_NNNN_Item_0")
```

**For INFO ScriptFragments:**
```
After scripts array:
  U8   unknownByte (0)
  WSTRING fileName
  U8   fragmentCount (usually 1)
  For each fragment:
    U8   unknown (0)
    WSTRING scriptName
    WSTRING fragmentName ("Fragment_0")
  U8   unknown (1 if has condition scripts, 0 if not)
```

### Step 12: Pipeline Integration

Add to `run/convert.py` as Phase 4 (after Phase 3: Assets):

```
Phase 4: Script Conversion
  1. Load cross-reference graph from export data
  2. Convert SCPT → .psc files
  3. Convert INFO ResultScript → fragment .psc files
  4. Convert QUST stage scripts → fragment .psc files
  5. Generate polyfill library
  6. (Optional) Compile via PapyrusCompiler.exe
  7. Copy .psc to output/scripts/source/
  8. Copy .pex to output/scripts/compiled/ (if compiled)
```

---

## Conversion Quality Tiers
<a id="conversion-quality-tiers"></a>

### Tier 1: Mechanically Correct (~60% of scripts)
Simple scripts with direct function mappings. No cross-script references. No complex expressions.

**Example:**
```oblivion
scriptname SE09RootGateScript
short open
begin onActivate
  if isActionRef player == 1
    message "The roots will not budge."
  endif
end
```
→
```papyrus
ScriptName TES4_SE09RootGateScript extends ObjectReference
Int Property open = 0 Auto
Event OnActivate(ObjectReference akActionRef)
  If akActionRef == Game.GetPlayer()
    Debug.Notification("The roots will not budge.")
  EndIf
EndEvent
```

### Tier 2: Needs Polyfill (~25% of scripts)
Uses functions without direct equivalents. Polyfill library provides replacements.

### Tier 3: Manual Review Required (~15% of scripts)
Complex patterns: state machines, multi-frame sequences, cross-script communication, MessageBox with choices, animation sequencing. Emit `;TODO:` markers.

---

## Testing Strategy
<a id="testing-strategy"></a>

1. **Syntax validation**: Every .psc must parse without errors (basic Papyrus grammar check)
2. **Property completeness**: Every referenced FormID/EditorID has a property declaration
3. **Event coverage**: Every TES4 block maps to a Papyrus event
4. **Function coverage**: No unmapped functions appear without `;TODO:` markers
5. **Compilation test**: If PapyrusCompiler.exe is available, compile all .psc and report errors
6. **Round-trip test**: Convert sample scripts, verify output matches expected Papyrus

---

## Known Limitations
<a id="known-limitations"></a>

1. **No VMAD generation yet**: The import script doesn't write VMAD subrecords. Scripts will compile but not attach to records until VMAD writer is implemented.
2. **Cross-script variable access**: `set QuestRef.VarName to value` requires knowing which script type is on QuestRef. Partial solution via cross-reference graph.
3. **MessageBox choices**: Oblivion MessageBox with buttons + GetButtonPressed needs synthetic Message form records. Initially emit `;TODO:`.
4. **Frame-rate dependent timing**: `GetSecondsPassed` has no Papyrus equivalent. OnUpdate interval is an approximation.
5. **Cell/location mismatch**: TES4 `GetInCell` uses Cell records; TES5 `IsInLocation` uses Location records (not created by converter).
6. **Animation events**: TES4 PlayGroup animation names don't map 1:1 to Skyrim animation events.
7. **OBSE extensions**: Scripts using OBSE functions (ar_*, sv_*, etc.) cannot be mechanically converted.

---

## Creation Kit Papyrus Compiler Contracts (2026-07-12)
<a id="creation-kit-papyrus-compiler-contracts"></a>

The bundled MIT compiler (`external/papyrus-compiler/papyrus.exe`) accepts code the
**real** compiler rejects, so a clean run there means nothing. Always validate with
`python tools/script/ck_compile_check.py` — it drives Skyrim's own
`Papyrus Compiler/PapyrusCompiler.exe`, the one the CK uses. A script that fails to
compile produces no `.pex`, so **the object it is attached to silently does nothing
in-game** — and it takes every script that references it down too (all member
accesses on it then fail), so one bad script can mask hundreds.

These contracts were each verified against `PapyrusCompiler.exe`:

| Contract | Symptom if violated |
|---|---|
| **ScriptName ≤ 38 chars.** Enforce via `constants.papyrus_script_name()` — the single source of truth for the `.psc` ScriptName, the `.psc` filename, AND the VMAD ScriptName (they must agree or binding breaks). Long names are truncated + given an MD5 tag, since many Oblivion EditorIDs differ only past the cut (`…RdCitadel0{1..5}SCRIPT`). | `"…" is too long, please shorten it to 38 characters or less`. 81 Oblivion scripts overflowed. |
| **No identifier may start with a lowercase `temp`.** The compiler mangles a variable `x` to the register `::x_var` and reserves the `::temp*` namespace for its own scratch registers. Case-sensitive, prefix-anchored: `temp`, `tempstage`, `template`, `temperature` all fail; `Temp`, `tmp`, `atemp` are fine. `_safe_property_name` capitalises the leading `t`. | `Attempting to add temporary variable named ::temp_var to free list multiple times` (558 errors from 15 scripts). |
| **No identifier may reuse ANY Skyrim script name** — not just native types. `Door`, `DarkBrotherhood`, `MS14` are all real Skyrim `.psc` files. The reserved list lives in `script_convert/papyrus_reserved.txt`, generated by `tools/generators/gen_papyrus_reserved.py` from `Data/Scripts.zip` (Bethesda's pristine archive — do NOT read `Data/Source/Scripts`, which on a modded install also contains the user's mods and would make conversion non-reproducible). | `cannot name a variable or property the same as a known type or script`, then `Door is not a variable` / `cannot call the member function SetStage … on a type` at every use. |
| **A rename must reach EVERY emission path.** Renames are only recorded when `safe != vname` (**case-sensitive** — `temp`→`Temp` differs only in case, and a case-insensitive test skipped it). Handlers that emit an operand *raw* bypass renaming entirely: `setstage`'s stage arg, `startquest`/`stopquest`'s quest arg, and `_convert_ref`'s quest path all had to be routed through `_convert_expression` / `_safe_property_name`. | Declaration renamed but body still references the old name. |
| **No doubled cast.** `X as Int as Int` is a parse error. Emit casts via `ScriptConverter._cast()`, which is a no-op if the expression already ends in that cast. | `no viable alternative at input 'Int'` — 1965 errors, the single biggest class, from just 116 sites (the CK reports each one many times). |
| **Bool-returning functions can't meet a number.** TES4's `GetDetected`/`GetDead`/`GetDeadCount` return Int 0/1, so scripts write `getdetected X > 0` and `set n to getdeadcount X + 3`. Papyrus refuses to order or add a Bool. `_BOOL_CMP_RE` casts the call; `GetDeadCount` (which has no Papyrus equivalent at all, and whose operand is a *base* form, not a reference) now emits a typed `0`. | `cannot relatively compare variables of type bool`, `cannot add a bool to a int`. |
| **`OnEffectStart`/`OnEffectFinish` take `(Actor akTarget, Actor akCaster)`.** The signature is fixed by `ActiveMagicEffect.psc`; an invented one is rejected. | `the parameter types of function oneffectstart … do not match the parent script activemagiceffect`. |
| **A `Global` function may not touch a script property** (there is no instance). `TES4Polyfill` is all-Global, so `GetDayOfWeek` fetches GameDaysPassed via `Game.GetFormFromFile(0x39, "Skyrim.esm")` instead of holding a property. | `variable GameDaysPassed is undefined`. |
| **`GetIsID` → `GetBaseObject()`, never `(x as Actor).GetActorBase()`.** TES4's `GetIsID` compares against *any* base form (the SE38 oddities are MISC/INGR/WEAP/KEY, not actors). `GetBaseObject()` is declared on ObjectReference (no cast needed, works for actors too) and returns a Form, which compares against every base type. Operands are typed via `_record_type_to_base_papyrus` (NPC_/CREA → **ActorBase**, not Actor). | `cannot cast a tes4_se38oddityscript to a actor, types are incompatible`. |
| **`_property_refs` must be keyed on `_safe_property_name(edid)` on EVERY write path** (`_add_scro_ref` *and* `_convert_ref`) — that is also the name `_collect_scro_properties` puts in the VMAD. Keying on the raw EditorID makes a *second* entry for any renamed EditorID (`MS14` → `myMS14`), so the "don't downgrade a promoted type" guard compares the wrong key, never fires, and the generic `Quest` from the SCRO beats the specific `TES4_MS14Script` promoted from the body. | `field or property QuestDone not found` / `field or property GoHomeRythe not found` — a `Quest`-typed property with a body calling quest-script members on it. |
| **Always pass `-nocache` to `papyrus.exe compile`.** Its cache keys on the *source* only, not the output path: an unchanged `.psc` is treated as already compiled, so it **exits 0 and writes no `.pex` at all**. Static scripts whose text never varies between runs (`TES4_ShowBarterMenu`, `TES4_ShowTrainingMenu`, `TES4Polyfill`) hit this every time. | Reported as a bare `exit code 0` "failure" with no error text, and the object the script is attached to silently does nothing in-game. |

### Quest scripts: gate the GameMode body on `IsRunning()`

In TES4 a **quest script**'s `begin gamemode` block only executes *while the quest is
running*, so its body routinely assumes that. Skyrim raises `OnInit` on the quest
object whether or not the quest ever started, and **`SetStage` on a stopped quest
STARTS it** — so an ungated body silently auto-starts the quest at load. This is why
"Imperial Dragon Armor" appeared in the journal on a new game: `MQDragonArmorQuestSCRIPT`
runs `if gamedayspassed >= armorFinishDay: setstage MQDragonArmor 20`, and at day 1
vs. an unset `armorFinishDay` of 0 that is immediately true.

The converter now wraps the OnUpdate body of any `extends Quest` script in
`If (!IsRunning()) … Return`, re-arming the poll while stopped so it resumes on its own
once the quest legitimately starts (211 quest scripts affected).

### <a id="batch-compilation"></a>Batch compilation, and why a failure is quarantined

**Code:** `papyrus_compile.py`.

`papyrus.exe` parses the ~3,000 Skyrim headers once **per invocation**, so
compiling per file paid that cost 15,961 times — ~82 ms each, about 22 minutes
of serial CPU, which is what a 4-core machine actually experiences. Batch mode
is ~2.4 ms/script marginal: the whole plugin in ~40 s in a single process, with
no dependence on core count at all.

The catch, and why this is not a plain swap: **the compiler ABORTS the run on
the first bad file and writes NO `.pex` at all** (measured: 1 broken script of
201 → 0 `.pex`). So a failing file must be quarantined and the batch retried.
Scanner and parser errors surface one file at a time; checker errors surface
for every bad file at once. Either way each error line names its file, so the
quarantine set grows by at least one entry per pass and the loop terminates
(capped at `_MAX_BATCH_RETRIES`).

A quarantined file has to leave the input directory, so once anything fails the
batch runs against a **staging copy**, built once and then maintained
incrementally — re-copying ~16k scripts on every retry costs far more than the
compile, and each retry only ever removes files.

Quarantined scripts are then re-checked **individually**, because a file is
frequently dragged into a batch failure by a *dependency's* error and compiles
perfectly well alone. Only a batch that cannot name any new failing file gives
up and falls back to the per-file path.

### <a id="operator-table"></a>The lexer operator table is longest-first

`lexer._OPERATORS` is scanned in order and the first prefix match wins, so a
two-character operator MUST precede its one-character prefix:

| operator | must beat | or else |
|---|---|---|
| `<>` (TES4 inequality) | `<` | `x <> 5` lexes `x < >` — not an expression |
| `->` (TES3 member) | `-` | `player->GetPos` lexes `player - >` |

`:=` is not TES4 at all, but costs nothing to recognise and keeps a mis-typed
script from lexing as two tokens that silently reparse.

**`->` is TES3's explicit-reference operator and means exactly what TES4 spells
`.`** — OpenMW's scanner lexes it as `S_ref` (`scanner.cpp:524-538`) and
`exprparser.cpp:475-485` consumes `S_ref` and `S_member` identically. So
`_OPERATOR_ALIASES` rewrites the token text to `.` at lex time and every
`Member` path downstream is untouched; no parser or emitter knows two
spellings.

Measured: 8,164 uses across 1,508 of TR_Mainland's 3,569 scripts, which failed
with "invalid right operand in infix expression" before the token existed.
**Zero** occurrences in Oblivion.esm's scripts, and no `- >` (spaced) anywhere
in either corpus, so the longest-first match is unambiguous.

### <a id="vanilla-headers"></a>Where the vanilla headers come from

The CK ships the vanilla `.psc` sources in one of two loose layouts —
`Data/Source/Scripts` (modern) or `Data/Scripts/Source` — or not at all, as
just `Data/Scripts.zip` on a fresh install. That archive is unpacked in place
into `Data/Source/Scripts`, which is also where the loose search looks first.
Without these headers nothing compiles: they carry the native type definitions.

An override plugin additionally needs its **masters'** converted sources on the
header path. Its scripts declare properties typed as the master's converted
scripts (`TES4_NQ16Script Property …`) because the record they name carries
that master's SCRI, and those `.psc` live in the master's own output — 198 of
Translation.esp's scripts fail with "undefined type" without them. They are
headers only; the master's own run compiles and ships the `.pex`.

**The walk is TRANSITIVE, not one level.** `TES4Polyfill` is owned by the
MASTERLESS plugin alone (see the static-script deploy in `pipeline.py`), and
every generated body calls it, so a plugin whose own master is itself a
dependent never sees it. Resolving one level left TR_Mainland
(TR → `Morrowind_ob.esm` → `Oblivion.esm`, and only `Oblivion.esm` is
masterless) with 2,324 scripts failing on `undefined identifier TES4Polyfill`;
walking the whole chain took it from 64 to 850 compiled. Nothing about this is
Morrowind-specific — any plugin two or more levels from the masterless root
hit it.

Order is **nearest master first, then its masters**, so a nearer plugin's
override of a script still wins the `-h` search ahead of the root's copy. A
header lists masters root first, so each level is walked from its LAST
`Master[i]` back; the walk once took them in header order and put the root
ahead of the patch that overrides it.
Each master is resolved through `record_dir`, never by joining its name onto
the export root: plugins imported from one mod archive share a folder named
for the MOD, so a plain join misses them.

## The Say fallback line length
<a id="say-line-fallback-duration"></a>

Fallback line length (seconds) a converted `set T to Say topic` assumes when
the topic has no measured audio.  The real value comes from the engine at run
time: TES4Polyfill.SayLine blocks until the INFO's OnBegin fragment reports
the selected line's own length (say_durations, `info:<FID>`), and only falls
back to this when the line has no voice file at all.  See the "Say() timers"
section of docs/commentary/script_convert.md.

## The StartQuest post-pass fails open
<a id="startquest-postpass-fails-open"></a>

`<Quest>.Start()` and a write to a property of that same quest's script.
🛑 If the emitted shape of a `StartQuest` conversion ever changes, this
regex must change with it: a post-pass that silently stops matching
FAILS OPEN -- no error, just the original bug back (measured: renaming
this call once re-clobbered 91 seed writes across 43 scripts).  See
docs/commentary/script_convert.md.

## Journal objective completion

**Code:** `script_convert/objective_completion.py`;
`script_convert/data/parallel_objectives.json`;
`tes4_export/record_types/dialog_misc.py` (`export_QUST`).
**Audit:** `tools/validate/objective_completion_audit.py`.

Oblivion's journal is an append-only log; Skyrim's is a set of objectives each
independently Displayed / Completed. A Displayed-but-not-Completed objective
renders as an open bullet with a live compass marker, so every converted quest
must say which step each stage FINISHES.

That is authored data, not something to infer. Oblivion's journal filter
(`Oblivion.exe` 0x52af40, reached from 0x52adf0 -> the condition evaluator at
0x56a950) walks the quest's subrecords matching `QSDT`/`CNAM` and evaluates
each log entry's OWN CTDA set, displaying the entry only while it passes. The
`ShowFullQuestLog` console command ("Show all log entries for a single quest")
exists precisely because the normal journal shows a subset.

Two idioms express supersession. Censused over the 950 log-entry CTDAs in
Oblivion.esm:

| Condition | Count | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `GetStage <quest> < N` | 102 | supersedes at N |
| `GetStageDone <quest> N == 0` | 167 | supersedes at N |

`GetStageDone` names its stage in **param 2**, not in the comparison value.
Only a LATER stage is a supersede: the same function against an EARLIER stage
(112 uses) selects WHICH WORDING to show. MS48 stage 20 is the worked example
— two entries on `GetStageDone MS48 10`, one `== 0` and one `== 1`, choosing
between two phrasings of the same step.

Other functions appearing on log entries (79 GetQuestVariable 249x, 84, 309
IsXBox) are not display-supersedes and are ignored.

**The export dropped all of this.** `export_QUST` parsed log-entry CTDAs into
`entry['ctdas']` and then emitted only Flags/Text/ResultScript/SCRO — targets
got their conditions written, log entries did not. 950 CTDAs across 71 quests
were silently lost, which is why the data looked absent and the completion
points had to be guessed from quest-target marker gates.

Where no authored gate exists the marker-gate inference remains as fallback:
an objective's step runs while its QSTA markers are live and ends at the first
stage they go dark. That is NOT "complete every lower-numbered objective" —
quests legitimately hold several objectives open at once, guarded by
`tests/test_script_converter.py::TestQuestObjectiveCompletion`.

### Only a CLOSING gate is evidence

A marker gate that never stops being satisfied says nothing about whether a
step finished. Reading it as "still in progress" stranded **617 of 6,312**
objectives (9.8%) across the big 3 — 607 of them because the marker rule
returned nothing and, being an `elif`, never reached the sequential default.
Quests WITH targets had 617 stuck of 4,819; quests WITHOUT targets had **0 of
1,493**, which located the defect.

MS48 is the worked example. Targets 0-3 are bounded (`GetStage >= 10, < 30`)
and complete correctly; Target 4 (SavlianMatiusRef) is `GetStage >= 50` with no
upper bound, so it is live at 50/60/70/80/90/200 and objectives 50-90 hung
forever — the reported bug.

`_target_closes` therefore counts a gate as evidence only when it can stop
being satisfied: a `GetStage` comparison with a closing edge (`==`, `<`, `<=`),
or ANY `GetStageDone` test. **GetStageDone must count.** 316 of 2,724 targets
are not purely GetStage-gated (47 GetStageDone only, 169 both, 100 neither),
and `fbmwBMStones`' six Standing Stone rituals are gated purely on
`GetStageDone` with no stage window — order-independent by construction.
Measured over every objective in every export:

| predicate | unchanged | stuck->closes | closes EARLIER | residue |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `GetStage` closing op only | 5181 | 498 | **51** | 65 |
| exclude any `GetStageDone` target | 5120 | 501 | **109** | 62 |
| **`GetStageDone` counts as closing** | 5240 | 487 | **3** | 76 |

The 3 remaining early closures were each read against their quest text and are
improvements, not regressions:

| objective | was | now | why |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `TrainingHeavyArmor` 10 | 30 | 20 | 10 is "go see Pranal"; 20 is Pranal's own request, so 10 is done |
| `fbmwTR09` 60 | 90 | 70 | 60/70 are two ways to extract the same promise; 90 is the alternate "I killed him" ending |
| `fbmwTR09` 70 | 90 | 80 | as 60 — answered by the next step, not by the later duplicate ending |

### Terminal stages are mutually exclusive

TES4 QSDT is `wbBoolEnum` "Complete Quest" — one boolean
(`wbDefinitionsTES4.pas:3212`). TES5's is a flags byte with bit 0 Complete and
bit 1 **Fail** (`wbDefinitionsTES5.pas:8811`): Bethesda added failure in
Skyrim, and Oblivion.esm contains **zero** QSDT values of 2 or 3. Success and
failure endings are the same bit, and **374 of 1,130 quests (33%) have 2+
ending stages** — SE44 stage 200 "Ahjazda rewarded me" beside 201 "Ahjazda is
dead". A sequential rule would close 200 with 201 in **572** cases, so
`_terminal_stages` excludes any flagged stage from ever being superseded.

Failure is therefore NOT inferable. The only signals are prose (39 of 2,338
Oblivion log entries match a failure vocabulary; just 17 of those also carry
the flag) and the stage-band convention, which **SE38 inverts** (190 failure,
200 success). Both are heuristics and are not used. `CompleteAllObjectives()`
on the flag settles endings dynamically instead.

### The runtime sweep

76 objectives across 19 quests remain unresolvable statically. Static analysis
cannot know which branch a player walked, but the running game can, so the
generated fragment asks it: an objective still Displayed and not Completed is
one the player saw and has moved past. A branch never taken was never
Displayed, so it is left alone — which is exactly "mark it only if it is
already in the player's journal".

Scored against the 76, hand-classified by reading all 19 quests:

| approximation | correct | wrong |
|---|---:|---:|
| blind sequential fallback | 33 | 43 |
| "run of >=3 unclosed => parallel" | ~48 | ~28 |
| **runtime displayed-and-incomplete sweep** | **61** | **15** |

The 15 are genuinely concurrent tasks — MQ11's six city gates, TGDirections'
four fences, ND02's four relics, SE13's obelisks — listed in
`parallel_objectives.json` and exempted from the sweep. A quest absent from
that table is swept normally; a miss leaves an objective open, which is the
pre-existing behaviour rather than a wrongly-ticked one.

**An order-independence probe over the 10,353 `setstage` callers does NOT
separate parallel from linear**: MS48 is linear yet has 14 ungated callers,
because dialogue-driven stages are ungated in linear quests too. The parallel
table is hand-read, not derived.

**The residue is a biased sample** — it holds only what the rules give up on,
so it can never reveal an objective the rules close WRONGLY. That is why
`objective_completion_audit.py --against` sweeps all 6,338 objectives; it is
what caught the 51 and the 109 above, neither of which appears in the residue.

## <a id="property-names-go-through-safe-property-name"></a>Every property name goes through `safe_property_name`

**Code:** `script_convert/constants.py`, `script_convert/converter.py`,
`script_convert/pipeline.py`, `tes5_import/dialogue/quest.py`

`safe_property_name` (and `sanitize_name` / `record_type_to_papyrus` beside it)
are the cross-package spelling contract for Papyrus identifiers. They carry no
leading underscore precisely because `tes5_import` imports them across the
package boundary -- 66 call sites in 13 files.

The rule is that a name reaches Papyrus through this function on **every** path,
because the same identifier must be spelled identically in the declaration, in
the body, and in the VMAD key. Three separate bugs came from one path skipping
it:

**Quest refs in the body.** An Oblivion quest EditorID can collide with a Skyrim
script name (`MS14`). Emitting it raw left the body calling `MS14.SetStage()`
while the declaration said `myMS14`; the CK then reads `MS14` as the TYPE and
fails with "cannot call the member function SetStage ... on a type".

**Sequence-counter conditions.** TES4 allows names Papyrus reserves (`endstate`,
`MS40`), so a raw variable name in a generated condition is a parser error.

**SCRO property keys.** Keying on the raw EditorID created a SECOND entry for any
renamed EditorID: the generic `Quest` from the SCRO and the specific
`TES4_MS14Script` from `_convert_ref` lived under different keys, so the
type-downgrade guard never fired and the generic one won the declaration --
leaving the body calling `myMS14.QuestDone` on a plain `Quest` ("field or
property QuestDone not found"). The key must be the Papyrus-SAFE name, which is
what `_convert_ref` stores and what `_collect_scro_properties` writes into the
VMAD.

A type already upgraded by `_convert_ref` (`Quest` -> `TES4_FGQuestTrack`) must
not be downgraded: `_preload_stage_scro_refs` runs once per stage and would
otherwise reset types promoted when an earlier stage's result script accessed
cross-script variables.

## Not every INFO needs a fragment — the dialogue stutter
<a id="info-fragment-stutter"></a>

**Code:** `script_convert/pipeline.py:info_needs_fragment`

🛑 **`info_needs_fragment` is the single source of truth.** The fragment
EMITTER (`_info_batch`) and the VMAD WRITER (`tes5_import.dialogue.converter`)
must agree exactly: a VMAD flag bit with no function behind it makes the engine
bind a missing function, and a `.pex` nothing attaches is dead weight. Both
call it.

### Why not always — the stutter fix

**Not confirmed to cure the stutter.** As of 2026-09-25 the user reports that
no fix aimed at the stutter when a scripted line starts has ever worked; its
cause is still unknown. The size and binding cost below are measured and
worth keeping regardless.

Every INFO used to get one, so the plugin shipped **19,278 per-INFO `.pex`
files** against vanilla Skyrim's ~5,500 — 100% of INFOs carrying a fragment
where vanilla carries one on **17.6%**, and **141 bytes of VMAD per INFO**
against vanilla's 14.

That cost falls **on the line-selection path**: when the engine picks a
dialogue line it must bind that INFO's fragment — load the `.pex`, link it,
resolve its properties — *before* anything is spoken. This matches every
symptom the other theories could not:

- it fires on plain NPC activation (no script of ours runs, but the greeting's
  fragment is still bound);
- it happens even when the voice file is **missing**, because binding precedes
  playback;
- it warms up on repeat, because a bound script stays loaded;
- consecutive lines reusing an already-loaded fragment do not stutter.

**54% of the fragments (10,417) contained nothing but the LineBegan/LineEnded
timing calls.** Those matter only for a topic a converted SCRIPT drives through
`TES4Polyfill.SayLine`, which blocks until `OnBegin` reports the line started.
A line the PLAYER picks never goes through SayLine, so its timing-only fragment
was pure per-line cost with no behaviour attached.

So a fragment is emitted only when it actually does something: the INFO has a
TES4 result script to run; it reveals AddTopic unlock globals; it opens a
service (barter/training) menu; or its topic is script-driven, so SayLine needs
the Begin/End hooks.

### <a id="poll-interval"></a>The OnUpdate poll interval

**Code:** `script_convert/poll_interval.py`, read by `assemble.poll`,
`assemble.lifecycle` and the `GetSecondsPassed` constant in `resolve_name`.

An authored quest delay wins. FNV writes one per quest
([export](tes4_export_falloutnv.md#quest-delay)); the pipeline maps each
quest's SCRI to it and `_scpt_batch` seeds `ScriptContext.quest_delay` before
`convert_standalone`, so the OnUpdate re-arm and the `OnInit` start both use
it. Values below 0.1 s floor at 0.1: `RegisterForSingleUpdate(0.01)` is every
frame, which is what 0.1 already delivers under load. The canteen quest's 300 s
delay is the fix for the sip message that fired every 0.5 s.

Without an authored delay the interval is content-driven: 0.1 s for a script
that reads `GetSecondsPassed`, 0.15 s for a Say timer, 0.25 s for any other
timer, else 0.5 s. The 0.15 s figure has history: 0.1 s was tried for Say
timers and measurably LENGTHENED the gaps between lines, so 0.25 s shipped.
That measurement was taken when every SayLine also blocked on
`Utility.Wait(0.05)` for its claim handshake and `Utility.Wait(0.25)` after
any busy wait, and when fragments blocked the dispatch path; the VM was
saturated by the Say path itself and extra poll passes queued behind it. All
three are gone, so 0.15 s buys back most of the tick latency without returning
to the 0.1 s measured as too aggressive.

### <a id="fnv-showmessage-menus"></a>FNV `ShowMessage <MESG>` + `GetButtonPressed` is the button-menu idiom

**Code:** `message_menus.button_messages`, `commands_falloutnv.show_message`,
`converter._mesg_for_show`.

Oblivion's choice menu is `MessageBox "text" "A" "B"` polled by
`GetButtonPressed`; FO3/FNV write `ShowMessage <MESG>` against an authored
MESG whose `Button[i].Text` rows are the choices, polled by the same
`GetButtonPressed`. The plan only knew `messagebox` lines, so an FNV script
that shows a buttoned MESG had no plan entry and its `GetButtonPressed` fell
to the dead `-1` — `VCG01SCRIPT`'s `bChooseSex` block (stage 17,
`VCG01ChooseSexMessage`: Mister / Ma'am) could never leave `nButton == -1`.
(That block is dead in vanilla FNV too — nothing sets stage 17 — but the idiom
is FNV's standard menu.)

An authored MESG with buttons that a script names in `ShowMessage` now enters
the plan under the MESG's own EDID with text None; `create_message_menu_records`
skips those (the record is converted by `convert_MESG`), the converter emits
`TES4_MsgButton = TES4_ShowMsg(<MESG>)` at the site, and `GetButtonPressed`
becomes the consume-once `TES4_TakeMsgButton()` exactly as for Oblivion. A
MESG without buttons keeps the row's plain `Show()`.

### <a id="furniture-use"></a>`IsCurrentFurnitureRef` / `IsCurrentFurnitureObj` read SKSE's GetFurnitureReference

Both were dead `0`s. Skyrim's vanilla `GetSitState()` knows no reference,
but SKSE (a required install) adds `Actor.GetFurnitureReference()`, so the
rows call `TES4Polyfill.IsCurrentFurnitureRef(actor, ref)` /
`IsCurrentFurnitureObj(actor, base)`. FNV's `VCG01DocMitchellCouchTriggerSCRIPT`
gates its `SetObjectiveCompleted VCG01 40` ("Sit down on the couch") on
`player.IsCurrentFurnitureRef DocMitchellCouchREF`, so the objective could
never complete. Its follow-up, `DocMitchellREF.StartConversation Player`,
still converts to a `Say(GREETING)` bark; the psych test then needs the
player to talk to Doc, since Skyrim has no scripted "open dialogue" call.

### <a id="fnv-objective-commands"></a>FO3/FNV objective commands

FNV drives the journal through objectives rather than log entries
([export](tes4_export_falloutnv.md#objectives)). Sites in FalloutNV.esm:

| Command | Sites (SCPT / INFO / QUST) | Papyrus |
|---|---|---|
| `SetObjectiveDisplayed Q idx [0/1]` | 49 / 372 / 213 | `Q.SetObjectiveDisplayed(idx, flag)` |
| `SetObjectiveCompleted Q idx [0/1]` | 21 / 522 / 177 | `Q.SetObjectiveCompleted(idx, flag)` |
| `SetObjectiveFailed Q idx [0/1]` | 0 | `Q.SetObjectiveFailed(idx, flag)` |
| `GetObjectiveDisplayed Q idx` | 557 / 325 / 41 | `Q.IsObjectiveDisplayed(idx)` |
| `GetObjectiveCompleted Q idx` | 551 / 346 / 40 | `Q.IsObjectiveCompleted(idx)` |

The flag argument defaults to 1, as in the GECK. `abForce` is left false: the
CK wiki defines it as re-showing an objective that was displayed before, which
FNV's call does not do. `SetQuestDelay Q secs` kicks one
`RegisterForSingleUpdate`, the same one-shot `set X.fQuestDelayTime` gets.

A quest with authored objectives gets no synthesized `SetObjectiveDisplayed(stage)`
in its stage fragments: the objective indices are not stage indices, and the
authored scripts already display them.

### <a id="fnv-unknown-objective-index"></a>Indices the quest never authored

FNV scripts call objective indices their own quest does not define.
`nVPrimmDeputyConv` authors ten -- 10, 15, 20, 21, 22, 25, 30, 34, 36, 37 --
and `PrimmDeputyQuestScript` polls `IsObjectiveDisplayed(31)`. The index is
absent from FalloutNV.esm, so this is authored dead code, not a conversion
dropout: Fallout ignored the call, while Skyrim logs `unknown quest objective
N` for every one. In a 2026-09-15 session that single call site produced 1,671
of 13,795 Papyrus errors, because it sits in a GameMode poll.

`quest_objective_indices()` maps quest EditorID -> authored QOBJ indices and
`quest_native` drops a call naming an index outside that set, emitting `;NE:`.

Keyed on the quest the call NAMES, never the script's own: of 6,625 objective
calls in FalloutNV.esm, 5,889 target a different quest. The guard needs a
literal index (6,625 of 6,627 are; the 2 variables pass through) and stays
silent for a quest that authors no objectives at all, so a quest whose
objectives this pipeline has not converted is never second-guessed.

## <a id="script-output-dir"></a>The script output directory: wiped, static scripts by ownership

**Code:** `script_convert/context_setup.py`, called from `pipeline.build_script_context`.

### <a id="wipe-output-dir"></a>Start from an empty directory

Which scripts the conversion produces changes with the plan and with the
source records, and nothing used to delete the ones that stopped being
generated, so they SURVIVED in `output/` and kept being attached. Measured:
scoping speaker-kind Say-timer owners stopped generating 10,268 bogus INFO
fragments, but the stale `.psc`/`.pex` stayed on disk, so Uriel Septim's
GREETING went on binding a fragment that cast him to two scripts he does not
carry: the line kept its subtitle on screen and never advanced to its
remaining two responses. Wiping is the honest form of the guarantee. Every
alternative (prefix lists, mtime "written this run" checks) needs a growing
set of exceptions for the static scripts deployed alongside the generated
ones, and each exception is another way to keep a stale file. After a wipe,
anything present IS something this run produced. Both source and compiled
output are cleared: a stale `.pex` is worse than a stale `.psc`, because the VM
loads it whether or not the source is still there.

### <a id="bounds-cache-schema"></a>The mesh-bounds cache must be current

A cache from before the HELD bit existed loads fine and answers 0 for every
mesh, so the release silently vanishes from every converted script. The
scripts stage cannot rebuild it (`--scripts-only` runs with no mesh scan), so
it warns instead of emitting quietly wrong scripts: breakaway/trap havok
releases are not emitted and planks and traps hang instead of falling until
the import or meshes step rebuilds the cache.

### <a id="static-scripts-ownership"></a>Static scripts belong to the masterless plugin

TES4Polyfill and the shared service-menu fragments are plugin-independent:
TES4Polyfill is Hidden with none but Global functions, and the two service
fragments are stateless TopicInfos. A dependent plugin shipping its own copy
just duplicates the master's `.psc`/`.pex` under the same script name, and
whichever loads last wins. Dependents still CALL them: the generated bodies
reference `TES4Polyfill.*` and INFO VMADs name the service fragments, both of
which resolve to the master's shipped copy (`phase_compile` puts every
master's source dir on the `-h` header path). Copies an older, pre-skip build
left in a dependent's output are removed: the stale `.psc` shadows the
master's fresh copy on the compile header path (Translation.esp's Aug-1
TES4Polyfill had no ReleaseBreakaway, so every script calling it failed to
compile), and the stale `.pex` ships under the same script name as the
master's.

## <a id="quest-fragments"></a>Quest-stage fragment scripts

**Code:** `script_convert/quest_fragments.py` (`quest_fragment_psc`), written by
`pipeline._qust_batch`; SCRO tables in `script_convert/scro_refs.py`.

A fragment is generated for every stage log entry that has journal text
(CNAM) or a result script. Each journal fragment calls
`SetObjectiveDisplayed` / `SetObjectiveCompleted` so the quest appears in the
Skyrim journal; without those calls CNAM text is never visible. A quest with
authored objectives ([FNV](#fnv-objective-commands)) skips them.

### <a id="one-objective-per-stage"></a>One objective per stage index

A stage has ONE objective (index = stage index) no matter how many journal
entries it carried in TES4: MQ01's tutorial stages ship a gamepad text and a
keyboard text, and emitting the objective calls per entry displayed the same
objective twice.

### <a id="complete-flag-ends-the-quest"></a>QSDT 0x01 completes the QUEST, not an objective

TES4 QSDT 0x01 marks the stage that ENDS the quest. TES4 has no fail bit: a
quest's success and failure endings are both flag 0x01, and 89 of Oblivion's
390 quests have several such stages. Nothing may be left hanging as an open
bullet, and which branch the player took cannot be known statically, so the
engine settles it: `CompleteAllObjectives()` closes whatever is still
displayed and leaves the never-shown entries of the skipped branch alone,
then `CompleteQuest()`.

### <a id="property-type-merge"></a>Merging case-variant property names

SCRO-derived properties and body-derived ones can spell one name in two
cases. The merge keeps the first-seen (SCRO-canonical) spelling so it matches
the VMAD binding, and the more specific type: a non-Quest type beats `Quest`,
and `ActorBase` beats ANY reference type, Actor and Actor-derived `TES4_*`
scripts included. Base typing comes from a base-semantics function
(SetEssential base); the VMAD binds that property to a base (NPC_/CREA)
record, and a reference-typed property bound to a base is UNBINDABLE: Papyrus
aborts the whole script's init, the quest never finishes initialising and its
aliases never fill (FGC01Rats: QuillWeave, an NPC_ base, was typed as the
Actor script `TES4_FGC01QuillweaveScript`). The same rule holds in
`scro_refs._add_scro_ref`: an `ActorBase` typing already set is never
overwritten by the SCRO's record type.

### <a id="unlock-globals-declared-once"></a>Unlock globals are declared once

The stage-reveal unlock globals are declared from `stage_reveals`. The
converter ALSO registers them, since a script `AddTopic X` emits
`TES4Unlock_X.SetValue(1)`, and a stage whose result script contains that
AddTopic is reached by both paths, so the declared set is seeded into
`property_declarations` or the same name is declared twice ("property with
`TES4Unlock_...` name already exists").

### <a id="quest-property-never-downgrades"></a>A quest property never downgrades to `Quest`

**Code:** `constants.typed_already`, used by `commands.stage`,
`commands.quest_state` and `commands_falloutnv.quest_native`.

The same quest is often reached both as a stage target and as a cross-script
variable owner (`Arena.SetStage 10` beside `Arena.ChorrolMatch`), and the
specific `TES4_<script>` type is what makes the variable read compile.
Overwriting it with the base `Quest` failed every such read ("field or
property ChorrolMatch not found"). A `TES4_XxxScript` extends Quest, so it
still answers Start/Stop/IsRunning and the objective natives. `Quest` is
enough when nothing is known: the SCPT-derived name would be wrong for the
lifecycle calls, since in TES5 the quest's VMAD script is `TES4_QF_<EditorID>`
rather than the SCPT name. The check is case-insensitive: Papyrus is, so
`CharacterGen` and `Charactergen` are ONE property, and an exact-match guard
let a later SetStage overwrite the specific type.

The FNV objective rows first carried `types={0: 'Quest'}`, which registers the
type unconditionally: 345 FalloutNV scripts then failed with "field or
property X not found" on quest-variable reads (`VMS16.nGangerDeathCount`).
