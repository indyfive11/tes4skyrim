"""Symbol tables for script conversion: what a name IS, resolved once.

The text pipeline answers "what type is this name?" by pattern-matching
emitted Papyrus, twice over, AFTER every script has been written:

  * `pipeline._fix_udf_call_arg_types` re-reads the whole output tree to find
    `Function TES4Call(...)` headers, because "signatures are only known once
    every script has been converted";
  * `pipeline._comment_undeclared_identifiers` re-reads it again to find which
    names a script declared, so it can comment out the ones it did not.

Both are rebuilding a symbol table by grepping generated files.  This module
holds the same facts directly:

  * `ScriptSymbols` -- one script's declarations, inferred property types and
    (if it is an OBSE user function) its parameter signature;

It also carries the six values the pipeline currently injects as MUTABLE
CLASS ATTRIBUTES on ScriptConverter (`say_durations`, `say_topics`,
`topic_unlock_globals`, `message_menus`, `chargen_menus`, `music_cues`) --
a hidden global channel that appears in no function signature and forces a
unit test to do global setup before it can convert a single line.

Nothing here converts anything; it only answers questions about names.
