"""Per-script conversion state.

`ScriptConverter` carried ~34 mutable fields re-initialised by a `_reset()`
method the constructor also called.  That is a per-script object written as
mutable attributes on a long-lived one: nothing said which fields belonged to
the script and which to the run, and a field that failed to reset leaked into
the next script (a `True` left in `_suppressed_fall_damage` appended a
RestoreFallDamage to an unrelated script's teardown).

`ScriptContext` is that state, declared once.  A new script gets a NEW
instance, so there is no reset to forget.
